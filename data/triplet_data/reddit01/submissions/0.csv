v26gkk,1654050248,Happy Pride Month to all LGBT+ Singaporeans!! :-),"Hello! Out here to wish all of my fellow LGBT+ Singaporeans a happy Pride month (tbf I wanna celebrate us all *EVERY* month, every day, every minute because we **deserve it** but then it'd get a bit too repetitive!)\n\nTo clarify to any non-queer people who aren't allies on the subreddit what Pride exactly means or it's origins, Pride month is celebrated in June as a commemoration to Stonewall, which took place in June 1969, indicating our resistance and resilience to how states and society are **violent** towards queer people. While this has roots in the United States, Pride is now celebrated worldwide, especially in Singapore with events like Pink Dot and a *whole host* of community gatherings, celebrations, and events.\n\nPride month, in my view, is two things that are *overlapping*. It's meant to celebrate each other for who we are, the love we share, without judgement or ridicule, knowing that, in the structures of society we live in, queer people are traditionally marginalized, which is to say that they don't have the same level of power or freedom to live their lives, and if they do, it's *in spite of* the state and society they live in. Basically, **Pride month is showing resistance to power that is violent towards queer people by celebrating, appreciating, lifting up, and loving who we are.**\n\nThis hits close to home, especially to people like me (a pansexual pal who's just realized they're non-binary AND a relationship anarchist). There may be some rumblings that 377A *could* be repealed, thanks to a speech by Shanmugam and that one REACH survey, but even if it does, queer discrimination, especially material privilege, is **more than 377A.** Heckin' Unicorn has a [great post here](https://heckinunicorn.com/blogs/heckin-unicorn-blog/the-price-of-being-queer-in-singapore-lgbt-rights-in-singapore#grand-summary), but here's a few notable ones. \n\nWe are still denied public housing until later in life as queer couples/family units can't get married/have a civil union, which prices out many queer people in finding safe, queer-friendly housing unless we rent (*which ain't too cheap in SG, and landlords can still kick queer people out*) or fork out tonnes of money (*which only those with existing privilege can realistically afford*) to buy a private place. For trans people, healthcare costs get seriously high for gender-affirming healthcare which trans people have to pay the brunt for, which also affects their own health if they *are not able* to receive such care that they need. Even for adoption rights, Singapore literally took the effort **this year** to close a legal loophole that previously allowed queer couples to adopt children. Not to mention that 'conversion therapy', a hokey, dangerous practice that people impose onto queer people to dispel the gay/trans out of them, is **not outlawed** in Singapore.\n\nRepeal or not, queer people will always be seen by state power to be *unfit to exist* in this nation, which is why Pride is SO IMPORTANT, because we *celebrate* who we are, how much we love and care for ourselves in this nation, to show that yes, we **do exist**, and we fucking love ourselves, because we are different, because we're diverse, and because we're **Q U E E R**.\n\nThere are many things going on this month, but the biggest thing is that, yes, **Pink Dot** is back to being an in-person event!! It will be held at Hong Lim Park on **June 18th, 3-7 p.m.** I will admit that, yes, Pink Dot isn't great at sharing space/power with diverse groups of queer folk, but gathering physically is the **best way** to find community in a state that discourages the formation of such communities. There are other events too (I believe PinkFest.sg has TONNES), but honestly celebrate in the best way for **you**. Whether that's physically gathering at a large event, going out for a private thing, meeting up with online pals, having a small party with fellow queer people you know, or even just celebrating **yourself**, Pride month is the time to celebrate yourself for being queer, and that's fucking awesome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/v26gkk/happy_pride_month_to_all_lgbt_singaporeans/
