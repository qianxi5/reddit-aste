ianbrg7,v1nao5,"> # How inspections at night unravelled a S$1.25 million subletting scheme on Airbnb and HomeAway\n\n> SINGAPORE: Inspections at night at rented properties in the heart of Singapore helped unravel a former real estate agent’s scheme to sublet homes for short-term accommodation.\n\n> Simon Chan Chai Wan, 57, was fined about S$1.16 million on Monday (May 30) for providing such accommodation on platforms such as Airbnb and HomeAway.\n\n> His girlfriend Zhao Jing, 43, was fined S$84,000 for helping him in the scheme by renting two properties and managing the online accounts.\n\n> The fine given to Chan was the largest amount handed out to a person in Singapore for such offences, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said on Monday.\n\n> Chan rented out 14 properties – two under Zhao and the remaining under companies HTM Solutions, HTM Management and SNS Infotech Global – between Jun 30, 2017 and July 2018.\n\n> They were directors of HTM Solutions and HTM Management for certain periods between 2016 and 2018, and Chan was also the former director of SNS Infotech Global.\n\n> Chan chose properties in the central areas of Singapore – River Valley and Orchard Road – as well as Keppel Bay, Tanjong Pagar and Telok Ayer.\n\n> The properties were rented for several months to a year and Chan paid between S$3,700 to S$4,200 per month to the property owners.\n\n> But at no time did either Chan or Zhao tell the owners they were being sublet for short-term accommodation.\n\n> Under URA regulations, all private residential properties rented out for accommodation purposes must have a minimum stay duration of three consecutive months.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653993463,t3_v1nao5,/r/singapore/comments/v1nao5/how_inspections_at_night_unravelled_a_s125/ianbrg7/

ianb2fg,v1n606,"> # Former bus driver jailed for injuring 14 people in Bukit Batok interchange collision\n\n> SINGAPORE: A former bus driver was on Tuesday (May 31) jailed for causing a two-bus collision at Bukit Batok interchange that injured 14 people last year.\n\n> Loo Eng Chai, 66, was sentenced to six weeks' jail and a five-year driving ban after pleading guilty to one charge of causing grievous hurt to six people through a negligent act.\n\n> Another charge of causing hurt to eight people through a negligent act was taken into consideration for sentencing.\n\n> At about 5.05pm on Jul 11, 2021, Loo had just started to drive bus service 945 operated by Tower Transit. Before starting the route, he checked the vehicle to ensure it was in safe working order.\n\n> Loo had reversed out of his parking lot and was driving along Bukit Batok Interchange when he approached the stop line at a T-junction. However, he failed to stop.\n\n> He continued driving and turned right into the junction without keeping a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles that had the right of way.\n\n> At the same time, another Tower Transit bus was entering the interchange from the main road. Loo failed to give way to this bus, which was travelling from his left to his right.\n\n> Loo collided with the other bus, causing it to topple to the left, fall down a slope and land on its left side. He also admitted to stepping on the accelerator lightly before the collision.\n\n> The impact of the other bus uprooted the roadside fencing at the accident site. The other bus also collided into a bus captain who was taking a break at the lower pavement at the bottom of the slope.\n\n> The incident was captured in photos and security camera footage that were circulated online. Videos of the incident were played in court on Tuesday.\n\n> All 14 injured people were taken to the hospital. This included 12 passengers as well as the driver of the bus that Loo collided into and the bus captain who was on a break.\n\n> The driver of the other bus suffered nasal fractures, hematomas and lacerations on his body. He received 43 days of hospitalisation leave.\n\n> The bus captain who was on a break suffered rib and other fractures and head injuries. He received 83 days of hospitalisation leave.\n\n> Deputy Public Prosecutor Chee Ee Ling sought six to eight weeks' jail and a five-year driving ban, arguing that Loo was driving a heavy vehicle with higher potential for harm.\n\n> Loo continued driving without due regard for the other bus, which had the right of way, said the prosecutor.\n\n> She highlighted that the six victims who experienced grievous hurt suffered injuries of a ""very serious or permanent nature"", which required significant surgical procedures.\n\n> Ms Chee also said that Loo's plea of guilt, show of remorse and absence of prior convictions were mitigating factors.\n\n> She added that the prosecution would not be seeking a compensation order as Loo did not have the means to pay.\n\n> Loo, who was unrepresented, told the court that he was now working as a cleaner, and that he needed to pay rent and support his family in Johor Bahru.\n\n> He asked for leniency so that he could be released ""as soon as possible"" to work and support his family.\n\n> In sentencing, District Judge Brenda Tan said that Loo's actions had caused serious harm and that his culpability was of a moderate to high level.\n\n> For causing grievous hurt through a negligent act that endangered the personal safety of others, Loo could have been jailed up to two years, fined up to S$5,000 or both.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653992915,t3_v1n606,/r/singapore/comments/v1n606/former_bus_driver_jailed_for_injuring_14_people/ianb2fg/

ianpycy,v1lrhp,Simple: We currently enforce other traffic laws with negligible societal costs (eg parking enforcement outside commercial areas). Why would we prioritise those over road safety measures with a direct societal and economic cost?\n\nNote Economic costs of child injury is far greater than that for adults given longer lifetimes over which costs (including productivity costs to the individual and their families) may manifest.\n\nI personally believe it’s worth enforcing existing road safety laws in the manner of other first world nations.

Once again, let me reiterate that the problem is bigger in your head than it really is.\n\nAnd lastly, I’ll just summarise my position and forever stay silent on this topic - not my hill to die on - I fully agree with you that safety is great, and one can easily do more to with at very little cost to improve safety. \n\nHOWEVER, to start doing draconian enforcement to ensure high level of compliance - why??? Where is the fire??? How many kids are we losing each year due to this non-compliance??? Why would anybody sane want to advocate even greater government oversight on something that is literally not an issue? \n\nFFS you are an expat, I’m gonna assume from the western world and I’m surprised you actually want more stricter regulation and enforcement? I thought SG government oversight is already too draconian for most of you guys.\n\nP.S. FWIW it’s as strict in SG as other countries - I’ve lived in NYC and London and even though it’s a must to have child seat rarely do you get stopped by police because of this - that’s if you bump into them even. Trust me if traffic police in SG see kids jumping around they’ll likely pull you over. \n\nYou guys in the western world aren’t doing this because of greater police state, it’s because you guys believe in it.

I’ve lived in UK and US and I’ve rarely seen traffic police doing anything more than speed traps.

Gosh the folly of Asian stupidity, if only we have more white saviour teaching us how to live better. \n\nOh wait, white saviour wants more police action? Dafuq?

ian37hw,v1lkeo,"> # How inspections at night unravelled a S$1.25 million subletting scheme on Airbnb and HomeAway\n\n> SINGAPORE: Inspections at night at rented properties in the heart of Singapore helped unravel a former real estate agent’s scheme to sublet homes for short-term accommodation.\n\n> Simon Chan Chai Wan, 57, was fined about S$1.16 million on Monday (May 30) for providing such accommodation on platforms such as Airbnb and HomeAway.\n\n> His girlfriend Zhao Jing, 43, was fined S$84,000 for helping him in the scheme by renting two properties and managing the online accounts.\n\n> The fine given to Chan was the largest amount handed out to a person in Singapore for such offences, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said on Monday.\n\n> Chan rented out 14 properties – two under Zhao and the remaining under companies HTM Solutions, HTM Management and SNS Infotech Global – between Jun 30, 2017 and July 2018.\n\n> They were directors of HTM Solutions and HTM Management for certain periods between 2016 and 2018, and Chan was also the former director of SNS Infotech Global.\n\n> Chan chose properties in the central areas of Singapore – River Valley and Orchard Road – as well as Keppel Bay, Tanjong Pagar and Telok Ayer.\n\n> The properties were rented for several months to a year and Chan paid between S$3,700 to S$4,200 per month to the property owners.\n\n> But at no time did either Chan or Zhao tell the owners they were being sublet for short-term accommodation.\n\n> Under URA regulations, all private residential properties rented out for accommodation purposes must have a minimum stay duration of three consecutive months.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653985901,t3_v1lkeo,/r/singapore/comments/v1lkeo/how_inspections_at_night_unravelled_a_s125/ian37hw/
