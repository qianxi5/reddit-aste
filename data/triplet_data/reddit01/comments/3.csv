ian9z28,v1kjq2,"Distress? I’m paying a bit more if I want to buy fresh, and the same if I go for frozen chicken… \n\nI’m sure the same is true for most Singaporeans, minus our poor hawkers. Having said that, the real distress will be the what Malaysian farmers, and Malaysians feel in the future.\n\nHere, it’s a matter of pivoting supply sources. We are no strangers to that, having done so repeatedly whenever our Malaysian neighbours pull the same stunt (pork exports in 1999, seafood in 2019, eggs in 2004 and 2018, now chicken in 2022). The only consequence was supply disruption for 1-3 months, coupled with higher prices, then its business as usual. What usually happens in Malaysia though would be smaller exporters going out of business.\n\nThis is going to be especially acute here since abang has instituted a price cap for almost 2 years, this coupled with rising feed prices and now an export ban will surely kill off the smaller-scale farmers who are already struggling, causing a further dip in available supplies. \n\nWhat worries me is more the political instability that inevitably follows when the food supply is in doubt (French Revolution of 1789, Venezuela 2014, South Sudan 2017, Yemen 2018 etc etc). This will be especially acute as Malaysia is also experiencing rapid currency devaluation as the Malaysian Ringgit is dropping to historical lows, affecting its ability to rely on imports to alleviate the situation. \n\nWhy should we care? Well, I have lots of friends and family in Malaysia, the same as many Singaporeans. Any suffering if their people is suffering of me and mine too when it comes down to it. Secondly, political instability in our neighbours is ultimately going to be bad for stability in the region and thus bad for business, which will affect our livelihoods, one way or the other.\n\nSo while we have fun bashing Malaysian politics and the stupid policies, please spare a thought for the common people. 🙏🏻",1653991997,t3_v1kjq2,/r/singapore/comments/v1kjq2/distress_in_singapore_as_malaysia_bans_chicken/ian9z28/

iamy8g5,v1kjq2,">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia will stop exporting chickens from Wednesday in a protectionist move to bolster domestic food supply, sparking distress in neighboring Singapore where chicken rice is a national dish.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced last week that, beginning June 1, Malaysia will ban exports of 3.6 million chickens a month until domestic prices and production stabilize. The move is felt most in Singapore, which sources a third of its poultry from Malaysia.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Almost all the chickens are imported live to Singapore, where they are slaughtered and chilled. Singapore consumers have been rushing to stock up on fresh chicken ahead of the ban, with local media reporting that shelves in some wet markets and supermarkets have been cleared of poultry.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The Singapore Straits Times said chicken sellers predicted the cost of chilled chicken could rise by up to 30%, sending chicken dish prices soaring. The Singapore government has urged consumers to switch to frozen chicken and other alternative meats, and is exploring new markets for fresh chicken.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>But there is concern over the fate of the ubiquitous chicken rice that is sold everywhere from hawker stalls to top hotels. Popular eatery Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, which gets its poultry entirely from Malaysia, reportedly said it will introduce pork and seafood dishes instead of using frozen chicken if it fails to find new suppliers.  \n>  \n>Malaysia’s protectionist move comes as countries worldwide grapple with soaring food prices, fueled partly by the Ukraine war. Ukraine is a major exporter of corn and grains that are key components of chicken feed. India has restricted sugar and wheat exports, while Indonesia temporarily halted — and then lifted — palm oil sales abroad.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Apart from the export ban, Malaysia also abolished import permits for chicken and other foods to boost food supply and curb prices amid public anger. It has earlier capped chicken prices and allocated subsidies for farmers squeezed by rising cost of chicken feed, partly caused by a weakening Malaysian currency.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The export ban came as a surprise by Ismail’s government, which took power in August and faces a general election next year. The government is also investigating claims that cartels are controlling the price and supply of chicken.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The ban not only caused alarm in Singapore but also troubled smaller Malaysian poultry farmers who supply to Singapore to help keep their operations afloat. The government didn’t say how long the export ban will last, but officials expect supply and prices to normalize within a month.",1653981410,t3_v1kjq2,/r/singapore/comments/v1kjq2/distress_in_singapore_as_malaysia_bans_chicken/iamy8g5/

iamrjve,v1jacs,"> # Man jailed for misappropriating S$343,000 from Gleneagles Hospital, forging patients' signatures\n\n> SINGAPORE: A manager at Gleneagles Hospital misappropriated more than S$343,000 from his employer by amending patients' bills and pocketing their cash refunds, forging some patients' signatures in order to avoid detection.\n\n> Thomas Ng Eng How, 48, was on Tuesday (May 31) jailed for three years and nine months after pleading guilty to one amalgamated charge of criminal breach of trust by an employee and eight charges of forgery.\n\n> Another 30 similar charges were considered for sentencing.\n\n> The offences, which took place from 2016 to 2018, were only discovered through an extensive audit on Gleneagles Hospital and other facilities under Parkway Hospitals Singapore.\n\n> Auditors noticed a large amount of cash refunds issued by Gleneagles Hospital as a result of Ng's actions, and the hospital made a police report in January 2018.\n\n> As a business office manager, Ng was able to make amendments to patients' bills in the hospital's computer system, although he was instructed to first obtain his superiors' authorisation.\n\n> During his employment, Ng learnt that the hospital had a practice of offering patients discounts or bill reductions by downgrading their hospital beds from time to time.\n\n> The discounts and reductions were implemented by amending the patient's bill. This could be done even after the bill had been fully paid and the patient discharged. The patient would then be issued a cash refund.\n\n> Ng saw in this an opportunity to misappropriate cash belonging to the hospital, the court heard.\n\n> Each month, he would identify bills involving patients who were foreigners, that were not covered by any insurance, and that amounted to more than S$30,000.\n\n> He selected these patients as he believed they were unlikely to return to Gleneagles Hospital as often as local patients, and less likely to discover that cash refunds had been issued in their name.\n\n> After these patients had made full payment to the hospital and been discharged, Ng would amend their bills to reduce the final amounts or instruct his subordinates to do so. He would then process the cash refunds and keep them.\n\n> In some cases, Ng tried to avoid detection by forging the signatures of the affected patients on cash refund slips issued by the hospital, to give the impression that they had acknowledged receiving the payments.\n\n> He forged such signatures on 36 occasions from March 2017 to January 2018, for amounts ranging up to more than S$26,000.\n\n> Ng used the misappropriated money to fund his personal expenses, including gambling and buying a car.\n\n> He was arrested on Jan 12, 2018.

iamm6du,v1ib3t,"> # Retail investors should steer clear of crypto even as S'pore addresses risks without stifling innovation: DPM Heng\n\n> SINGAPORE - Crypto assets like cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are constantly evolving and highly risky but have the potential to transform the future of finance, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Tuesday (May 31).\n\n> He warned that retail investors should steer clear of cryptocurrencies even as Singapore adapts its rules to address the key risks that crypto assets pose.\n\n> ""Retail investors especially should steer clear of cryptocurrencies. We cannot emphasise this enough,"" he said.\n\n> Mr Heng was speaking at the opening of the second Asia Tech x Singapore summit at The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore hotel in Marina Bay, organised by the Infocomm Media Development Authority.\n\n> He noted that crypto assets have gathered much interest due to their phenomenal growth and promises of high returns and, more recently, the crash of Terra Luna, which caused many investors to suffer heavy losses and triggered knock-on effects on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n> Nevertheless, Singapore will continue to adapt its rules to ensure that regulation remains facilitative of innovation, the minister said.\n\n> Mr Heng said crypto assets are part of a new wave of emerging digital technologies known loosely as Web 3.0 and the way to approach this is to keep an open mind.\n\n> ""We must pierce through both the hubris and the veil of suspicion to understand the potentially transformative underlying technologies,"" he said. ""Let us not throw out the baby with the bathwater.""\n\n> This is because the digital asset ecosystem comprises an entire range of services beyond cryptocurrency trading.\n\n> ""We remain keen to work with blockchain and digital asset players to encourage innovation, and build up trust in the sector,"" he added.\n\n> In the last two years, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has granted licences and in-principle approvals to 11 digital payment token service providers, including stablecoin players like Paxos, crypto exchanges like Coinhako and traditional financial institutions like DBS Vickers.\n\n> At the same time, MAS has consistently warned the public against trading in cryptocurrencies and took steps to limit promotion of cryptocurrencies to the general public earlier this year.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653972171,t3_v1ib3t,/r/singapore/comments/v1ib3t/retail_investors_should_steer_clear_of_crypto/iamm6du/

iamswjv,v1ib3t,"Then let me make this very clear: You are more wrong than you're right.\n\nWe only occasionally see investors go against the market in general because they've done the math and realised things like the stock for a company is valued below the actually assets of the company, or that there will be a rush to buy stock as too many people have shortened it. Mostly most people only react to what other people are doing, or what they think that other people will be doing.\n\nIf for instance a company is reporting less growth than earlier the market drop in value will not represent only that less growth, instead it will be people reacting to what they think that other people will be doing. That's why you often see dips that quickly go deeper than where a stock stabilise perhaps just an hour later. Because people reacted to people, not to actual value.\n\nThere are no schemes or scams or whatever in that, it's just that people react to people, and people invest in other people's willingness to later on pay a different amount of monies for something.

But that value comes from people being willing to buy it, so it really just has a subjective value. If you were to get stuck with your gold in a bomb shelter without food or water you'd quickly learn that there's no objective value in gold, because it's practically worthless without people wanting to buy it. (Enough gold bars and it would do a decent job of preventing radiation from nukes, though; so it does work as the super rich man's lead as a construction material in bomb shelters.)\n\nDeFi values sounds great on papper, because just like with my example about gold the DeFI thoughts are happening within a certain type of stable market. So DeFi works when and where DeFi works.\n\nBut look at what happened when the embargos started hitting Russian banks; crypto transfers started happening differently.\n\nAlso look at the amount of hacking and blackmail happening where crypto can be traced going to North Korea.\n\nCertain types of deregulation and decentralisation will at large enough scales simply favour the already rich and powerful, leaving the little person at a disadvantage that we don't have in a more restricted system.",1653980805,t1_iamu0fj,/r/singapore/comments/v1ib3t/retail_investors_should_steer_clear_of_crypto/iamxjqg/

LED wreaths are no longer permitted in the establishment.\n\n> ""Six LED wreaths can cause the power to trip. Our CCTV and network router systems were interrupted.""\n\n> A Tampines funeral parlour forbid the use of LED wreaths starting this month due to safety concerns, and because they pose as a potential fire hazard.\n\n> ""Around end-March, the power to our funeral parlour started tripping multiple times a day. The sound system and microphones we use during chanting all require power, and the addition of the LED wreaths causes the electrical circuit to overload.""\n\n> Some funeral parlours allow LED wreaths\n\n> A funeral director who wished to remain anonymous told Shin Min that some families find LED wreaths too festive, which is why the director chose to ban the wreaths.\n\n> Instead of a complete ban, some funeral home operators allow the use of LED wreaths under certain conditions.\n\n> One Teochew funeral operator along Ubi Road, which also faces issues with power trips on a daily basis, currently only permits a maximum of five LED wreaths.\n\n> The operator added that mourners who wish to display LED wreaths would have to find their own power generator, which could cost upwards of S$1,000, considering transportation and petrol fees.\n\n> Shin Min reported that LED wreaths were adopted from Taiwan and introduced to the Singapore market in 2019 when suppliers saw a business opportunity here.\n\n> A Singapore Casket spokesperson stated that they had prohibited them when they were first brought to Singapore, adding that the LED wreaths are three to four times brighter indoors than outdoors.\n\n> Death Kopitiam Singapore said on May 30 that they have written to all town councils in Singapore to gain clarity about the use of LED wreaths at funerals in the estates under their care.\n\n> Follow and listen to our podcast here\n\n> All images by Death Kopitiam Singapore/FB.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653967376,t3_v1gz74,/r/singapore/comments/v1gz74/multiple_funeral_parlours_in_spore_ban_led/iamek86/
