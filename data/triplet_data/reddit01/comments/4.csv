ialu6t3,v1ddv2,"> # Robust pay rises in Singapore last year tempered by inflation\n\n> SINGAPORE - Most workers saw pay hikes last year, but rising prices meant that their gains were tempered.\n\n> With a large majority of companies raking in profits, 70 per cent of workers saw their pay packets expand, with resident workers who had stayed in their jobs for at least one year taking home an extra 3.9 per cent on average.\n\n> But inflation ate into their gains and their spending power increased by just 1.6 per cent - less than half of their nominal pay hikes.\n\n> Despite nominally bigger pay cheques, workers have fared worse only once over the past five years. That was in 2020, when real wage growth was 1.4 per cent despite prices dipping marginally.\n\n> Some 59 per cent of workers saw their nominal pay increase in 2020. The biggest hikes went to junior executives, who have become the most sought-after segment of the workforce.\n\n> Prospects appeared brighter last year as the economy expanded 7.6 per cent and three in four companies were profitable. But an inflation rate of 2.3 per cent diluted real gains for workers.\n\n> High prices are expected to persist for the rest of the year as lockdowns in China and the Ukraine war worsen supply bottlenecks, said Dr Hong Ru, assistant professor of banking and finance at Nanyang Business School.\n\n> “The key is how fast we can get out of this supply chain issue and to really increase productivity. If we can do this fast, we will be in a good position next year,” he said.\n\n> Inflation is expected to peak at 4 per cent between July and September before easing in late 2022.\n\n> Recruiter Michael Page, which reported that most firms were planning to give annual increments of 3 per cent this year, expects that bigger hikes would be made after September.\n\n> Its managing director, Mr Nilay Khandelwal, said: “This is when we would really know what exactly would be the AI (annual increment) and inflation rates. Generally speaking, Singapore AI is pretty much tied to the inflation rate to a large extent.”\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653956744,t3_v1ddv2,/r/singapore/comments/v1ddv2/robust_pay_rises_in_singapore_last_year_tempered/ialu6t3/

Just when COVID-19 cases in Singapore have fallen back to lower levels, we are experiencing yet another outbreak, this time of a more familiar foe – dengue.\n\n> The number of cases reported so far this year has already exceeded the whole of 2021 and is already climbing towards the levels in 2020 when Singapore saw its worst dengue outbreak.\n\n> Why is this happening despite efforts by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the public in mosquito control?\n\n> To borrow terms we’ve become familiar with over the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effective reproductive number – the number of people infected by the mosquitoes infected by one dengue carrier – needs to be kept below 1 to curb transmission. And that isn’t currently happening.\n\n> We know some circumstantial factors that may be responsible for the current outbreak. The recent warm weather is conducive to mosquito population growth. DENV3, the current dominant serotype behind the large majority of cases now, has not circulated at such levels before 2021.\n\n> But here are two broader factors we think are responsible for why outbreaks like the current one still persist: Ever lower population immunity and ever better diagnostics. Ironically, both are good problems to have.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653948409,t3_v1b5hq,/r/singapore/comments/v1b5hq/commentary_why_is_there_another_dengue_outbreak/ialdy7x/

iak9c3v,v14ftb,"> # Forum: Make jobs that require physical labour more attractive to Singaporeans\n\n> I fully support Forum writer Chia Eu Foong's call to make cleaners' jobs more attractive (Make cleaner job more attractive, May 18) by giving better perks and conditions of service.\n\n> Jobs such as cleaning toilets and wiping tables at foodcourts and hawker centres, removing garbage from bin centres in HDB estates, repairing roads and working at construction sites are mostly done by foreign workers. The salaries paid are often low. Singaporeans shun these jobs.\n\n> These jobs are very important and essential to keep Singapore clean and the economy moving forward. For example, if garbage is not cleared from bin centres for even one day, the estates would stink.\n\n> Currently, there are many workers in other countries who are willing to work in Singapore because of the Singapore dollar's strength and the weaker economy in their own countries. But what if this were to one day change? As Singaporeans will not do these jobs, what would happen to the country then?\n\n> The present over-reliance on foreign workers to do these jobs is inadvisable. A good example is how Build-To-Order flats have been delayed due to the foreign labour crunch.\n\n> To entice Singaporeans to do these jobs, the salaries, perks, conditions of service and status have to be improved drastically, whether employers like it or not. Introduce more automation instead of merely relying on physical labour.\n\n> The authorities will have to look into this matter urgently to see how Singapore can be more self-reliant in labour.\n\n> Pavithran Vidyadharan\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653929465,t3_v14ftb,/r/singapore/comments/v14ftb/forum_make_jobs_that_require_physical_labour_more/iak9c3v/
