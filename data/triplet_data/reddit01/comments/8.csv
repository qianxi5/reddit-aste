iaidxt1,v0scom,"> # 'If you do it your way, I slap you': Woman gets jail for repeatedly assaulting maid\n\n> SINGAPORE: A woman who was unhappy with the way her domestic worker did housework repeatedly assaulted the maid by slapping and hitting her.\n\n> Zhao Lin, 35, was on Monday (May 30) sentenced to five months' jail and a fine of S$1,000.\n\n> She pleaded guilty last month to four charges of voluntarily causing hurt and one count of mischief for damaging a phone that the victim bought to contact her family.\n\n> Another four charges were considered for sentencing.\n\n> The court previously heard that the victim, a Myanmar national, started working for Zhao in February 2016. Zhao was her first employer.\n\n> The victim's job scope included taking care of Zhao's son, who was aged about four at the time.\n\n> Zhao started abusing the victim in 2017 by hitting her because her work or attitude was purportedly not satisfactory.\n\n> She also deducted S$100 to S$200 from her maid's S$500 salary each month for mistakes made at work, such as breaking crockery.\n\n> The victim accepted the salary deductions as she ""did not know what would happen to her if she refused"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Teo Lu Jia.\n\n> WHAT HAPPENED\n\n> Zhao was working as a nurse at the time of the offences on Aug 25, 2018, which were captured by closed-circuit television cameras around the home.\n\n> The abuse started around midnight that day, when Zhao accused the victim of not keeping her son's toys properly.\n\n> Zhao told the victim, then 25, to ""stand properly"" and slapped her forcefully 10 times, loudly counting several of the slaps.\n\n> The victim did not retaliate. After slapping her, Zhao went on to sort her son's toys while saying: ""I will do it until you are really, really scared.""\n\n> The victim subsequently teared and cried quietly when she was alone.\n\n> In the morning, Zhao slapped the victim 10 times again as punishment for forgetting to wash some laundry.\n\n> A more sustained assault took place later that day, at about 4.30pm. The victim was cleaning the living room when Zhao suddenly asked her to stop and slapped her.\n\n> Zhao scolded the victim for the way she was vacuuming the floor and told her to ""use your eyes to see"".\n\n> Shortly after, Zhao slapped the victim again forcefully. The victim was shocked and spoke to the accused.\n\n> Zhao then shouted at the victim: ""Do it my way! What you're doing is your way! Everything I teach you, everything cannot remember!""\n\n> Zhao continued shouting at the victim, who replied again. Zhao got angry and hit the victim's arm and pulled her hair while shouting.\n\n> She swung her hand and hit the victim's cheek and arm, and kicked her twice at her upper thigh.\n\n> When the victim used her hands to block the blows, Zhao shouted, among other things: ""How dare you?!""\n\n> Zhao's son was in the living room during this assault and asked his mother why she was hitting the maid, to which she replied that the victim ""did wrong"" and ""hit mum"".\n\n> When Zhao stopped hitting her, the victim continued with housework while Zhao shouted various things, including: ""If you do it your way, I slap you. I will make sure you remember that, and my slap is always harder.""\n\n> About half an hour later, still unhappy with how the victim had done housework earlier, Zhao walked up to the victim and slapped her forcefully again.\n\n> The victim did not retaliate. For the next 15 minutes, Zhao continued scolding her about various issues.\n\n> She pulled the victim's hands, kicked the victim at her upper thigh and hit her arm repeatedly while scolding the woman for ""arguing"" with her.\n\n> At about 5.15pm, the victim called the police. She had not reported the assaults earlier as she was afraid of losing her job and feared Zhao, the court heard.\n\n> While the victim was making the police report, Zhao stared at her. When the call ended, Zhao immediately slapped the victim forcefully, hit her head, pulled her hair and kicked her while shouting.\n\n> When police arrived, they asked to view the CCTV footage but Zhao refused to show it to them.\n\n> Zhao's husband returned home later and informed the police officers that there were memory cards in the CCTV cameras. These were seized for investigations.\n\n> The victim was taken to the hospital, where she was found to have a contusion on her forehead and abrasions on various parts of her body.\n\n> Zhao also suffered bruises from the victim's efforts to defend herself against the assaults.\n\n> ""HUMILIATING"" ABUSE, SAYS PROSECUTION\n\n> The prosecution sought at least five to seven months' jail and a fine of about S$1,000, highlighting the victim's vulnerability as a migrant without a support network and in a subordinate position to her employer.\n\n> Ms Teo argued that the sustained abuse caused increasing psychological harm with each escalating incident, adding that the victim would cry and feel traumatised when she recounted what happened.\n\n> The nature of the abuse was also ""humiliating"", as it was calculated to bully the victim into submission, said the prosecutor.\n\n> Defence lawyer John Koh raised Zhao's post-natal depression in mitigation, although Ms Teo argued that this was found not to have a significant contributory link to Zhao's offences.\n\n> Zhao earlier made voluntary compensation of S$6,300 to the victim for the pain and suffering she experienced, her prospective earnings during unemployment and the damage to her phone.\n\n> The punishment for voluntarily causing hurt is jail for up to two years, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. Zhao was liable for an enhanced penalty of one-and-a-half times the maximum punishment as she committed the offences against a domestic worker.\n\n> The offence of mischief is punishable with jail for up to one year, a fine or both.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653885695,t3_v0scom,/r/singapore/comments/v0scom/if_you_do_it_your_way_i_slap_you_woman_gets_jail/iaidxt1/

iaior05,v0scom,"Wait till u see this..\n\n\nIn November 1990, Choo issued a false invoice from his company claiming to have sold equipment worth more than a million dollars to Wong See Kee, Choo's brother-in-law. Wong had used the invoice to get S$830,000 in financing, supposedly to pay for the purchase of the equipment. In 1999, Choo was charged with cheating. He resigned from his MP position and PAP before pleading guilty in court to a charge which was reduced from aggravated to simple cheating.\n\n\nChoo's former fellow MP and Senior Counsel, K Shanmugam, represented Choo. Shanmugam pushed for a fine instead of a jail sentence. Petition letters by grassroots leaders, vouching for Mr Choo's character, described Choo as ""hardworking,"" ""compassionate,"" ""selfless"" and dedicated to community service. Lee Hsien Loong, the then Acting Prime Minister, said that Choo has done the right thing in resigning as an MP and PAP member, before pleading guilty in court.\n\n\nChoo was sentenced to two weeks' jail and fined S$10,000.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) received several anonymous complaints against Choo alleging that he had charged his personal airfares, expenses, phone bills to STTA and received gifts from Chinese coaches and players. The total amount involved about S$10,600. The offences were allegedly committed during Choo's tenure as the president of the STTA.\n\nThe CPIB conducted investigations revealed that in 2005, Choo had received S$1,500 from Liu Zhongze, who was then a national team player, and Luo Jie, who was then an assistant coach of the STTA, in return for giving Liu more opportunities to represent the STTA in table tennis tournaments. Between 2003 and 2004, Choo is believed to have accepted USD$600 on two separate occasions from Shi Mei Sheng, who was then a STTA coach for approval of usage of two different training facilities in China.\n\n\nOn 8 December 2011, Choo was charged with three counts of corruption and one of criminal breach of trust. Koh Li Ping, former High Performance Manager of STTA, was also involved in the criminal breach of trust charge.\n\n\nThe CPIB said that between 2002 and 2003, Luo Jie, whose work pass only permitted him to work for STTA, provided table tennis training to students of Fuhua Secondary School. But the school was unable to pay him for the training provided, which amounted to S$8,400. Luo Jie told Choo and Koh about this, both of them then allegedly arranged with the school principal to engage STTA in a new training arrangement. The proceeds for the new training arrangement received will be used to pay Luo Jie for the outstanding fees. After STTA received the payment from the school, Koh obtained approval from Choo to authorise a payment of S$8,400 to Luo Jie, even though the latter did not provide any training services under the new training arrangement.\n\n\nChoo was acquitted of his charge of criminal breach of trust after the prosecution dropped the three other counts of corruption and proceeded with the criminal breach of trust charge\n\n\n\nhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/topic/cheating\n\n\nI see other cheating cases get sentenced way more than 2 weeks.\n\n\n>	According to court documents, Tay was sentenced to 30 months' jail on Monday.",1653893547,t1_iaineh4,/r/singapore/comments/v0scom/if_you_do_it_your_way_i_slap_you_woman_gets_jail/iaior05/

iam2nc1,v0s237,"Lawyers actually don't do that. They are not counsellors or investigators. Lawyers also prefer to go to trial for the fees involved. As they represent the client and paid for by the client, they will follow the instructions of the client. They will however provide an estimate of cost if it goes to trial and most will ask for money upfront. \n\nSome clients will ask what their chances are and the lawyers will provide what evidence is against the client but not say what the chances are as they are so many unknowns. In this case, the victim had a video recording of their conversation which victim's friend's help record. And victim did say that he revealed his age which DK acknowledged. Very damning.\n\nMost people go to trial for serious cases despite overwhelming evidence so they can say to family and friends they are innocent. Save face. (The court was wrong, lawyer not good, police fixed them up, framed by victim) \n\nDK at his previous court appearance stated his intention to plead guilty but did not agree with DPP's Statement of Facts. So they sought an adjournment to agree on the SOF. The next day, DK attempted to carve out his own (misleading and sly) narrative and put out a video. That video was then removed. I suspect AG Chambers had a word with his lawyers and the deal on the number of charges preferred and to proceed might have to change as he was playing games. \n\nSo it was no surprise that the SOF was unusually lengthy and transparent for someone pleading guilty.

iaioxwo,v0s237,"We don't have American-style plea deals in Singapore courts. We have the representations process. It's a negotiation between the accused and prosecution. One common approach is to set out mitigating factors and then say your client is prepared to take a certain course of action (i.e. plead guilty) if the charge is reduced/PP does not ask for custodian sentence. But none of these binds the court. The judge's sentencing powers are not fettered by what the prosecution asks for, though in practice the judge do take them into consideration.\n\nThe other issue is the accused must admit to a Statement of Facts. Any attempt to quality this admission or any sign that the accused believes the Statement of Facts is inaccurate will lead to rejection of the guilty plea. So if you go to PG and start saying shit like, I'm innocent, I didn't do this, or I did this but not that, but I have no choice but to plead guilty because blah blah, your guilty plea will not be accepted. \n\nDo people plead guilty even though they are innocent?

iai56me,v0qzdq,"> # Total wage growth rebounded to 3.9% in 2021, but real growth in salaries dampened by higher inflation\n\n> SINGAPORE: Total wage growth rebounded to 3.9 per cent in 2021, comparable to before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, but real wage growth was dampened by higher inflation last year, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) said on Monday (May 30).\n\n> Real wage growth came in at 1.6 per cent in 2021 amid higher inflation last year. That figure is only slightly above the 1.4 per cent registered in 2020, and lower than the 3.3 per cent in 2019.\n\n> ""The strong recovery of Singapore’s economy and a tight labour market prompted more employers to raise their employees’ wages in 2021, following a period of wage moderation in 2020,"" said MOM.\n\n> ""As a result, more employees received wage increases last year, and wages also grew at a faster pace than in 2020.""\n\n> Total wage growth, including employer Central Provident Fund contributions, among resident employees who have been with the same employer for at least one year was 3.9 per cent in 2021 - the same as 2019. This is up from the 1.2 per cent recorded in 2020.\n\n> ""The rebound in total wage growth in 2021 reflects the broad-based economic recovery across industries, and a tight labour market due to border restrictions slowing down the inflow of non-resident labour,"" the ministry said.\n\n> After the global financial crisis, total wage growth rebounded the following year in 2010 to 5.7 per cent in the period of recovery.\n\n> While 2021's total wage growth also rebounded, it was lower than 2010, suggesting that employers may have been ""more cautious given the longer tail"" of the COVID-19 pandemic, said MOM.\n\n> ""As COVID-19 had a less severe impact on wages compared to the global financial crisis, wage growth also had less ground to recover in 2021 compared to 2010,"" added the ministry.\n\n> THREE IN FOUR EMPLOYERS PROFITABLE IN 2021\n\n> With Singapore's economy expanding by 7.6 per cent in 2021, the proportion of profitable employers increased from 63 per cent in 2020 to 75 per cent last year, enabling some employers to restore wage cuts made in 2020.\n\n> About 70 per cent of employees had wage increases in 2021, compared to 59 per cent in 2020, said MOM.\n\n> The extent of their wage increases was also higher in 2021 (6.3 per cent) than in 2020 (4.5 per cent). The proportion of employees that saw wage cuts in 2021 (10 per cent) was about half of 2020 (23 per cent).\n\n> Among employees who saw wage cuts in 2021, the wage cuts were less steep than in 2020.\n\n> SECTORS REGISTERED HIGHER TOTAL WAGE GROWTH\n\n> All sectors experienced higher total wage growth in 2021 compared to 2020, said MOM.\n\n> Outward-oriented sectors, in particular information and communications, financial and insurance services and manufacturing, registered healthy expansion even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to see ""strong wage growth"" in 2021, said MOM.\n\n> The information and communications sector saw total wage growth of 5.1 per cent, followed by the financial and insurance services at 4.1 per cent and manufacturing at 4 per cent.\n\n> Among domestic-oriented sectors, retail trade registered the highest wage increase at 5.5 per cent.\n\n> Sectors that were more affected by the pandemic also registered wage increases as demand for manpower rose in tandem with the reopening of borders, said MOM.\n\n> ""2021 saw a rebound in total wage growth, in tandem with the broad-based economic recovery,"" said MOM.\n\n> ""Real wage growth was dampened by rising inflation but remained positive and grew slightly faster compared to 2020.\n\n> ""In 2022, we expect the tight labour market to support continued nominal wage growth, although the significant relaxation of border restrictions will allow the non-resident workforce numbers to recover and ease some of the tightness.""\n\n> Downside risks to the global economy remain, such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and protracted global supply disruptions. MOM said this could moderate demand and nominal wage growth.\n\n> With recent shocks to the global supply chains, inflation is projected to stay elevated and dampen real wage growth this year, the ministry added.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653880715,t3_v0qzdq,/r/singapore/comments/v0qzdq/total_wage_growth_rebounded_to_39_in_2021_but/iai56me/

But I feel that MND's statement tries to gloss over the unhappiness over the recent spike in prices by using the phrase ""generally kept pace"". Why only ""generally""?

iai4sl3,v0qxhj,"> # The Big Read: Generational gap — a bridge too far or are we making too much of it?\n\n> Dr Mathew Mathews, a principal research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), acknowledged that the difference between generations is certainly real but there are many areas where aspirations are similar.\n\n> Pointing to results from the World Values Survey conducted by the IPS and released last year, Dr Mathews said the difference in opinion between generations here is actually “fairly small”.\n\n> “For instance, there are many priorities that all of us, regardless of age group, tend to embrace — we all have similar views about the importance of the family and the need to respect our elders.\n\n> “Both young and old in Singapore also take great pride in our country and its institutions — we recognise the social values that have helped steer the nation,” he said.\n\n> Agreeing, Asst Prof Ang said on climate change, for instance, Singaporeans across generations recognise it as a real problem that needs to be addressed, rather than it being a hoax or a conspiracy.\n\n> And on LGBTQ issues, most across the generations will probably agree that LGBTQ individuals should not be discriminated against.\n\n> “These are important commonalities that we should not downplay, especially in a society where different generations have come of age in vastly different environments,” he added.\n\n> HOW TO BRIDGE THE GAP\n\n> Rather than adopting the divisive practice of stereotyping each generation, individuals can instead focus on the commonalities that they share in order to bridge the gap, said the experts.\n\n> Asst Prof Ang said: “Older cohorts need to fight against the tendency to infantilise younger cohorts, while younger cohorts need to fight against the tendency to demonise older cohorts.”\n\n> To facilitate this, opportunities to allow meaningful cross-generational interactions must be created — whether in school, the workplace or at home, and also beyond these spaces.\n\n> Integrating more adult learners into university classrooms, for instance, can provide a safe space for engagement across generations, he added.\n\n> The NYC poll also highlighted how workplace and community initiatives could be useful in addressing the generational divide and dialogues could help bring different generations together to appreciate each other’s lived experiences.\n\n> So how should individuals seek to bridge the gap?\n\n> Ms Theresa Pong, the counselling director of The Relationship Room, which work with couples and families, said it is important to firstly, remain curious about why people may have differing views and secondly, to be respectful when addressing those views.\n\n> “When you are curious, you will seek the rationale for why people do things because there must be a reason. That’s when the wall can be lowered and true communication can happen.\n\n> “And when you can respect each other’s views, there is this thing called safety in communication. That’s when we know that when we share our views, it won’t be put down or be used against us,” she added.\n\n> Mr John Shepherd Lim, the chief well-being officer of Singapore Counselling Centre, said while it is not practical to expect all perspectives to be fully aligned and individuals to be fully agreeable at all times, there is a need to be mindful of extreme thinking or the “my way or the highway” stance.\n\n> Individuals should also avoid “black or white thinking”, or looking at issues in a straightforward manner, he added.\n\n> “At times we need to layer our perspectives. And we need to understand the context of each party’s viewpoints,"" he said. ""Because once we understand the context and we know where the (other) person is coming from, it is a lot easier to understand, and a lot easier to perhaps negotiate a certain stance.”\n\n> He added that apart from deciding what can be negotiated, it is also helpful for both parties to talk about the issue when they are in better control emotionally.\n\n> Speaking from her own experience, Ms Tan, the actress, said that when it comes to bridging the mother-daughter gap, she sticks to the mantra of ""never sweat the small stuff"".\n\n> “I don’t care what she wears, how she puts her makeup on or how late she stays up at night. I don’t sweat the small stuff. But we talk about the big stuff — our values in life, what’s right and what’s wrong ... we talk about education and work ethics,"" she said.\n\n> For Mr Fairul, the freelance performer, the unending support from the older folks within his family, especially his mother, has given him the confidence to have open conversations about the challenges he faces.\n\n> He said: “She’s very present in my life. She keeps herself up to date with what I’m doing, and she also makes the effort to be friends with my friends. It’s because of her I feel supported and can do the things that I want to do.”\n\n> This article was written in partnership with the National Youth Council and was originally published in TODAY.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653880524,t3_v0qxhj,/r/singapore/comments/v0qxhj/the_big_read_generational_gap_a_bridge_too_far_or/iai4sl3/

iaj1qvy,v0qqoi,"Fans are very useful. A ceiling fan at maximum speed consumes at most 100 Watts while an air conditioner uses 3000 Watts (3 kWh per hour) to cool the room and 500 Watts to maintain the temperature. This is because fans do not cool the air, but rather recirculate cooler air from the rest of the room to replace the film of warm 37 degrees Celcius air around your skin. \n\nIn terms of electricity consumption, fridges use the most electricity as it is run 24/7, consuming 200W or 1 kWh every 5 hours. If you have your TV on and you are not currently watching it, it is better to switch it off as all electronic devices convert their electrical energy to heat energy as their end product. \n\nTo save electricity cooling yourself given the increasing electricity tariffs, use more fans instead. Fans use far less energy than AC. Drink water to cool yourself, water has a high heat capacity.  If you want to use the AC, turn on the fan so that the air is circulated and the AC spends minimal time at maximum power.\n\nAnother way to cool yourself more is to switch to a laptop or undervolt your computer. A desktop PC draws about 500 Watts and a laptop about 200 Watts. For those stuck with a desktop, you can switch off your discrete GPU when not gaming, or use Throttlestop to limit CPU clock rates. This can save almost 200 Watts of power and make the surrounding air less warm. \n\nFor those using laptops, use blu-tack/ felt pads/ small eraser and raise the back of the laptop so that the laptop can vent the hot air out towards the rear of the laptop rather than being trapped under the laptop and dispersing the heat. \n\nMobile users should refrain from charging while using the device as charging will be slower and more inefficient also due to increased temperature. Additional power use results in more wasted heat.",1653905108,t3_v0qqoi,/r/singapore/comments/v0qqoi/the_weather_is_too_damn_hot/iaj1qvy/

iaj4r2l,v0pl3e,"Compensation is a function of the Market. Companies do have to deal with this. People wanting to quit jobs for more money is hardly news :)\n\nFlexibility is a function of your role and to some extent culture. Roles, where people don't need to be glued to their seats or need to work in a specific window, should be flexible in those aspects. Not being flexible doesn't buy an employer anything and is IMHO just dumb. That said, flexibility is a double-edged sword and can leave your job vulnerable to being exported unless it has a regulatory tether to Singapore.\n\nTraining is the more interesting one of these. I am of course talking about the kind of training that leads to a certification or even a formal degree from an appropriate accredited body/university ( not - watch this video on youtube ...). Some certifications are expensive. Some require a commitment of time. If a company is willing to sponsor an employee in terms of time and/or cost, that's a win for both sides, provided the employee works there in the long term.\n\nMany MNCs do sponsor their employees for such programs provided they have worked for a certain number of years, have performed well, and are willing to work for at least a fixed number of years after the certification/degree is done.\n\nQuestion is - is an employee willing to commit to the company for at least a minimum period if the company spends time/money on their certification? With a pro-rata clawback clause if they leave before that...\n\nSome good companies will use this as an opportunity to introduce such programs. But don't expect everyone to do it.

iai2t3k,v0pl3e,"SINGAPORE - The pandemic unleashed not only a virus but also a seismic ceding of control from employers to workers worldwide and in Singapore.\n\nAnd it is not letting up as local workers keep up their expectations of more flexibility, training and pay in their jobs, according to surveys out this year.\n\nConducted by firms ranging from talent recruiters Michael Page and Randstad, and human resource consultants Mercer and KellyOCG, to tech companies Cisco and UiPath, these reports all reflect a consistent finding: A majority of local workers intend to quit in the coming months if their demands are not met.\n\nExcept that their bosses, too, are mulling over leaving: 81 per cent of 67 senior executives say they plan to resign within these two years, citing poor work-life balance as one reason in KellyOCG's findings. That statistic is higher than 69 per cent in Asia and 72 per cent globally.\n\nKellyOCG managing director Peter Hamilton expects the trend to persist given the talent crunch. ""Our survey shows that globally, 37 per cent of employee expectations have changed since the pandemic.\n\n""They have higher expectations around work-life balance, flexible working, benefits, well-being support. This figure is higher in Singapore at 43 per cent.""\n\nCompared with the rest of the world, local employers are less prepared to deal with the new aspirations foisted on them. About 12 per cent of them, compared with 15 per cent globally, fared well in an aggregate score that grades firms on employee experience, agility such as in the use of contingent workers, factors including diversity, and adoption of technology.\n\n\nGet tips to grow your investments and career in weekly newsletter\nEnter your e-mail\n Sign up\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.\n\nOnly 21 per cent of local companies said they are engaging employees on flexible work arrangements versus 33 per cent globally, Mr Hamilton said.\n\nIn Mercer's study, 62 per cent of staff say not being able to work remotely or hybrid permanently is a deal breaker when considering whether to join or stay with an organisation.\n\nAbout 86 per cent of C-suite executives, on the other hand, fret over the impact of permanent hybrid and remote working on office bonding, while 60 per cent believe ""fundamentally, work gets done in an office, not remotely"", the report adds.\n\nAuditor Urvish Sawalani, 25, sees no reason for bosses to call workers back. ""We can wake up and start later, but as long as we get the job done, that's what matters.""\n\nHe added: ""I think the perks that emerged to support employees during Covid-19 will become the new norm."" He also noted that employers were ""trying very hard"" to woo talent, including giving handouts to new employees to buy equipment for working from home.\n\nStaff engagement and choice are recurring advice to employers in the reports.\n\nMr Ravin Jesuthasan, Mercer's global leader of transformation services, said: ""The companies that will win are the ones who make it as easy as possible for people to engage with their company and do their work.\n\n""It's not going to be the companies that say, 'I give you flexibility, but you have to be in the office four days a week and those four days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday'. It is not flexibility if it is not a choice.""\n\nMORE ON THIS TOPIC\nS'pore salary guide: Are you getting paid as well as your peers?\nThe Great Renegotiation: Five views on what's changing about work, and what's not\nChoice, however, is not on employers' side, said Associate Professor Tan Hwee Hoon of the Singapore Management University.\n\nUntil the labour market eases, ""employers are unlikely to dictate where employees work"", she added.\n\n""There is no going back to the five-day work week. Some folks are talking about a 10-month work year, pointing to the need to provide more flexibility rather than less. What is happening in the labour market now is a movement towards employee preferences.""\n\nDespite all that, plus supply chain bottlenecks and inflation, employers are ""cautiously optimistic"" in their outlook, said the Singapore National Employers Federation.\n\nThe employers' trade union is urging bosses to offer versatile work locations, hours and contracts to tap underused labour sources and adopt automation and technology such as robots.\n\n""Technology: If you do it well, you can literally reduce your headcount costs to a fraction of what it is today,"" said its executive director, Mr Sim Gim Guan.\n\nUltimately, workers and employers are on the same team, said Mr Jesuthasan. But unless a global recession sets off a ""reset"", leverage will continue to tilt ""towards the employee side, or maybe stay the same"", he said.\n\nMORE ON THIS TOPIC\nHow Singapore firms are ramping up employee perks in fight for talent\nWork/Life: Bosses have no choice, okay?!\nThe 280,000 local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that hire about 70 per cent of the workforce here are getting the brunt of the talent churn, said recruiters.\n\nMr Kurt Wee, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, said: ""There is a disconnect between what companies need and how the workforce wants to work.\n\n""I will caution everybody not to be overoptimistic because we are facing a globally volatile situation. Employers are facing substantial cost increases on all fronts and there is a bit of job hopping going on.""\n\nCompanies need to recover productivity after the past two difficult years while grappling with a shortage of blue-collar workers, he added.\n\nThe tightening on the import of foreign labour is hurting SMEs, said Mr Wee. ""If you look at the real cost of hiring, and the number of locals you have to hire to hire foreign manpower, it's really expensive.\n\n""A company could feel that the labour supply conditions do not justify doing business any more and decide not to continue.\n\n""Another scenario is businesses deciding to downsize, because if they cannot get labour, why scale?""\n\nMr Sim said: ""Everyone is still readjusting, but by May next year, I believe we should be able to find an equilibrium.""",1653879525,t1_iahxor9,/r/singapore/comments/v0pl3e/the_great_renegotiation_spore_workers_want_more/iai2t3k/

Paya Lebar Air Base\n\n> Two of Singapore's air bases - Changi East and Tengah - are being expanded to accommodate the assets of Paya Lebar Air Base, which will move in the 2030s.\n\n> The move will free up about 800ha of land for development, with Mr Lee saying that height restrictions on surrounding areas will also be lifted.\n\n> He said the area possesses heritage and greenery, as well as opportunities for new housing and amenities.\n\n> The Singapore Institute of Architects and the Singapore Institute of Planners are working on plans for the area, which will be displayed for public feedback in June when the Urban Redevelopment Authority exhibits its long-term plans, said Mr Lee.\n\n> In April, he said proposals for the area included creating a heritage district out of old airport buildings.\n\n> 2. Greater Southern Waterfront\n\n> With a coastline of about 30km, the Greater Southern Waterfront, stretching from Pasir Panjang to Marina East, requires a lot of work and planning, said Mr Lee.Freeing up land to develop the waterfront will require the relocation of facilities that are critical to Singapore, he said.

iaiqs1n,v0pbdb,"The difference to me is that the area around MBS was reclaimed to support an extension of the CBD, while the ports were meant to be ports, so I don't think they can be considered equivalent. It's like how there's an MRT line running through the reclaimed land under MBS, but the extension from Marina Bay to Harbourfront is going to be the most costly per kilometer for any tunneling project in Singapore due to the soil conditions. It's likely possible, but it won't be cost effective.",1653895232,t1_iaipwa3,/r/singapore/comments/v0pbdb/3_bold_projects_to_meet_singapores_needs_in_the/iaiqs1n/
