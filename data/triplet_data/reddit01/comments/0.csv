iaql0wn,v2670h,"If you check the [URA master plan website](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps), you would have noticed a few past master plan available for viewing, such as the 2019, 2013, 2008 and 2003 ones. But the first of the Development Guide Plans which follows this modern style, the one for 1998, is missing. Perhaps an attempt to erase the mistakes of the past, which is a shame, for the 1998 plan is quite a bit more detailed than the 2003 one.\n\nAs it turns out, it is available for viewing on the [National Archives of Singapore website](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/). Here, you get the 1998 master plan in discontinuous sections. I went to stitch up certain portions of it covering the Simpang planning area, revealing a plan that is drastically different from that of even the [commonly shared napkin sketch online](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Simpang_New_Town_%28merged%29.png).\n\nIt is interesting to note that there are no signs of MRT or LRT systems in this map, which perhaps is meant to be planned afterwards for this town. The common plot ratios here for residential areas are 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.1 and 2.5, as opposed to the 2.8 in most HDB towns, with roads further from each other while narrower than plans nowadays, suggesting that this town would have been a lot less dense than usual if it had went ahead. Perhaps it would be a nice breather from the crowds we see nowadays. Notably, is also split into 2 sections with no connections between each other; a strange design choice for a supposed town.\n\nStill, many of the design principles here seemed to have since been incorporated into newer towns. For example, linear parks along the coastline and surrounding the modified Sungei Simpang, provides residents a means to run or cycle from the periphery of the town to the Simpang Town Centre marked in blue, which are features similar to My Waterway @ Punggol in Punggol New Town, or Forest Stream and Tengah Pond in Tengah New Town. A new reclaimed island at the northern tip of the town provides a nice seaview similar to the Northshore district of Punggol, except it is even better as people living on that island would have a 360° view of waters, which is not ruined as much by the Pasir Gudang Industrial Area in Johor.\n\nIt is sure a shame that this plan did not come into fruition, but it may also be a blessing given how much of a clusterf*ck Yishun has become. Simpang would have made the crowd there worse without additional rail connections. In 2 decades’ time, come the 9th MRT line, perhaps a new generation of urban planners will reimagine the design of the last new town in Singapore built out of forests. Or perhaps the forest will continue to be conserved as a military training ground, who knows.",1654049401,t3_v2670h,/r/singapore/comments/v2670h/how_simpang_new_town_could_have_looked_like/iaql0wn/

This results in politicians who are not very competent being elected on that single issue. Politicians become so entrenched in this single issue that they neglect other important issues. The economy has not been doing well for almost a decade. Graduates are finding it difficult to get good jobs. Housing is becoming more and more unaffordable for everyone.

I'm not saying that Taiwan will become one. But it also does not look that any major shift will happen in the right direction soon.\n\nTo me, a successful democracy is Switzerland.

iaqagp9,v24mje,"> # In bad taste? National Crime Prevention Council removes Amber Heard meme\n\n> SINGAPORE - The National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) has removed from its Facebook page a controversial meme featuring an image of Amber Heard from the defamation suit between the actress and her ex-husband, actor Johnny Depp.\n\n> The post, which was uploaded last Thursday (May 26) and shared 1,000 times before it was taken down on Monday night, uses a viral moment from Heard's testimony about Depp conducting a ""cavity search"" on her - sexually assaulting her with his fingers after accusing her of hiding his drugs.\n\n> While recounting what happened following the incident, Heard winces and says her dog stepped on a bee and had to be taken to a veterinarian.\n\n> The NCPC's meme used Heard's wincing face but replaced her line of ""My dog stepped on a bee"" with other one-liners that rhyme with ""bee"". Similar memes have been appeared on meme sites like SGAG, where one such TikTok video received over 16,800 likes.\n\n> The NCPC apologised for the post on Tuesday night. In a statement, it said: ""We had used the photo as we thought the expression captured how members of the public might react when they spot the various signs of scams. It was not our intention to demean or insult anyone. We apologise for the post and any offence caused, and will do better in our efforts to outreach to Singaporeans about scams.""\n\n> Gender advocacy group Aware warned that such jokes and memes about the Depp-Heard trial, regardless of its outcome, can harm survivors of domestic violence.\n\n> In response to ST queries, Ms Kelly Leow, senior communications manager at Aware, says the ""sheer ubiquity"" of social media content about the trial makes it ""practically impossible for survivors to go even one day without encountering such content online"".\n\n> She adds: ""Those who have experienced domestic violence themselves would likely be re-traumatised by witnessing scenes from the trial itself, in which acts of violence are detailed at length, and also by the outpouring of callous jokes surrounding the trial.""\n\n> Ms Rachel Lim, 29, a survivor of intimate partner abuse, has been ""troubled"" by the deluge of social media content about the defamation case.\n\n> ""The verdict is not even out yet and even if it was, this is in very bad taste,"" the content strategist says.\n\n> She adds: ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But when you share or create a meme you have to understand your own intentions - are you trying to create a more peaceful world or are you trying to direct hate towards somebody?""\n\n> Ms Leow adds that the way that this trial has been presented in the media and on social media tends to erase nuances, turning a complicated situation into a black-and-white, he versus she narrative.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1654044402,t3_v24mje,/r/singapore/comments/v24mje/in_bad_taste_national_crime_prevention_council/iaqagp9/

It did not specify what the grounds were.\n\n> It also said it is in contact with certificate holders who have been importing meat from TFIL to obtain alternative halal-compliant supplies.\n\n> It added that it will be conducting checks to ensure compliance by its certificate holders, and stressed that any use of non-halal compliant supplies would be in breach of Muis halal standards.\n\n> On May 16, Muis said in a Facebook post that it was investigating allegations against TFIL, after the Malaysian authorities suspended a slaughtering approval granted to it.\n\n> The Straits Times understands that imports from TFIL amount to only a portion of imported meat from Australia, and that the supply of halal meat to Muis-certified establishments will not be adversely impacted.\n\n> Malaysian media outlets had reported earlier in May that the suspension of approval followed alleged violations of halal slaughtering procedures.\n\n> Muis had said then that it was working with the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to ascertain relevant information on TFIL from the Australian Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment.\n\n> It had also said that the abattoir is accredited by the SFA to export meat to Singapore.\n\n> In a Facebook post on Tuesday, the head of the council halal supply network, Mr Sharifuddin Mohamed Ali, reiterated Muis' findings, and thanked the Muslim community for its understanding on the matter.\n\n> ""Muis is highly committed to maintaining the integrity of the supply of halal food to the Singapore Muslim community, and will continue to provide updates and advice to the community in this respect,"" he said.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1654011530,t3_v1t2zn,/r/singapore/comments/v1t2zn/muis_instructs_halal_certificate_holders_here_to/iao9ix6/
