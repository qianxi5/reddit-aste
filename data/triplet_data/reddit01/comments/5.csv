In addition, workers should be equipped with safety equipment to prevent falls,"" the ministry added in its statement to ST.\n\n> There were 20 workplace fatalities between Jan 1 and May 6, with 10 in April alone.\n\n> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on May 9 in a Facebook post that the recent spate of workplace fatalities is unacceptable.\n\n> ""We have been working hard for years to prevent workplace accidents, especially deaths,"" he wrote.\n\n> ""We have made good progress. But with our economy reopening and activities ramping up, safety standards and practices seem to have slipped. Accident rates have gone up, and we have lost ground. We must put this right.""\n\n> MOM, Workplace Safety and Health Council, National Trades Union Congress and industry partners urged companies to impose a two-week safety timeout to review risk assessments and familiarise workers with safety procedures.\n\n> More than 12,000 companies had called a timeout by mid-May.\n\n> Singapore has a long-term goal of reducing workplace fatalities to a rate below one per 100,000 workers by 2028.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653926667,t3_v13g9n,/r/singapore/comments/v13g9n/worker_dies_after_falling_20m_from_roof_of/iak2yxx/

iajilke,v103em,"> # Importers facing export ban ask S'pore clients to take chicken parts instead of ordering whole bird\n\n> SINGAPORE - Chicken importers facing a Malaysian export ban that kicks in from June 1 are urging their clients to accept what parts - such as breast or wing - are available, rather than order the whole bird.\n\n> For their part, importers are ramping up processing before the ban, stockpiling as much chicken in chillers and freezers while they can to counter uncertainties ahead.\n\n> ""We are working with our customers and have asked them to switch to different... parts, depending on what's available,"" said Mr James Sim, head of business development at importer Kee Song Food.\n\n> Its clients include online retailers, supermarket chains, restaurant groups, wet markets and chicken rice stalls.\n\n> For example, chicken rice stalls that normally opt for whole chickens have been asked to take on parts instead.\n\n> Malaysia is currently facing a chicken shortage, with Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announcing on May 23 that it will halt the export of up to 3.6 million chickens a month from June 1, until domestic prices and production stabilise.\n\n> The Straits Times reported over the weekend that suppliers in Malaysia are working overtime to deliver chickens here.\n\n> Importers here have also been putting in extended hours.\n\n> Companies like Kee Song have tripled the usual number of shifts to process fresh chickens before the ban sets in.\n\n> Last week, the Singapore Food Agency said the Animal & Veterinary Service extended operating hours for inspection of live poultry at Tuas Checkpoint from May 25 to May 31.\n\n> ""More chickens than usual came in over the weekend... we've brought in about 30 to 40 per cent more chicken per day, but that's all we can process due to limitations of time and labour,"" said Mr Sim, who added that live chickens have to be processed within 24 hours.\n\n> ""A portion of it will be kept frozen, and I foresee we will be able to last for one to two weeks before stocks are depleted,"" he added.\n\n> As a company that exclusively imports live chickens from Malaysia, it is expecting to take a 90 per cent to 95 per cent hit in revenue in the coming weeks.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653916915,t3_v103em,/r/singapore/comments/v103em/importers_facing_export_ban_ask_spore_clients_to/iajilke/
