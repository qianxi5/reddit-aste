iah5vjh,v0lpqh,"Most people leaving, said Pei, are headed to same place: Singapore. \n\n“Everyone’s going to Singapore,” said Pei, especially those working in finance, law and recruitment, she said.\n\nKay Kutt, CEO of the Hong-Kong based relocation company Silk Relo, agreed, saying people are attracted to the ease of business, family friendliness, tax incentives and open borders of Singapore.\n\nIn its 40-year existence, the past three years have been the busiest years on record for Silk Relo’s sister moving company, Asian Tigers, she said.\n\n“We cannot keep up with the capacity,” she said. “We don’t have enough people to serve what’s going on in the marketplace.”   \n\nFamilies are transferring to Singapore, she said, but small- and medium-sized businesses are also on the move. Whereas one company executive might have left in the past, now “they’re all going,” she said. Small companies are “taking the entire team and putting them into Singapore.”\n\nLarge companies are also relocating to Singapore, said Cynthia Ang, an executive director at the recruitment firm Kerry Consulting. She cited L’Oreal, Moet Hennessy and VF Corporation — the latter which owns brands such as Timberland and North Face — as examples, while noting there are more who haven’t made their decisions public yet.",1653862424,t3_v0lpqh,/r/singapore/comments/v0lpqh/thousands_of_people_are_leaving_hong_kong_and_now/iah5vjh/

Like if guy is immature by throwing around cash, maybe it's because a past gf dumped him for not spending enough on her or being ""cheap"" and now he's worried it'll happen again with OP. Maybe the guy makes crass jokes because everyone always just ""laughs"" to avoid a conflict and nobody has talked to him about when they're appropriate yet.\n\nAs for your smoking example, I've seen compromise happen multiple times between romantic partners as well as friends.

Looking back, I was the first child and my parents probably had no idea how to deal with a mischievous boy on top of other responsibilities in life.\n\nI turned out fine but I was never close to them.\n\nWhen my wife was expecting my girl. I started to worry. Despite knowing that I strived not to be like my parents, I also acknowledged the human tendency to choose the familiar. \n\nImplanted in my mind was this warped logic- If I turned out fine, therefore hard love and violence should be okay for my girl, it was also the only method I knew.\n\nSo started asking around and went for a course recommended by a friend. I honestly thought that being soft makes you weak but I told myself- Go learn something, if it fails, I can always go back to what I am good at.\n\nI learned that despite our good intentions, it was the way we speak/communicate that was crucial- how someone can perceive your good intention differently. I learned that approaching things empathetically helps lower defenses and alleviates anxiety. I learned the difference between being soft and firm. I learned that I can choose to be a father my girl feared, a father she will come when she only needs things or be a father that she can talk to. \n\nI observed that change is hard, the older participants in my course found it harder to adapt than the younger participants.\n\nI learned that knowing is not enough, it’s like learning a magic trick and there is a need to keep practising and reflecting. I practised on my nieces and colleagues.\n\nI learned that in our asian culture, we were taught to dismiss our feelings and it has effects on us- I observed that an angmo can go elaborate how fantastic their day was with a range of feeling descriptions. An Asian usually would say that their day was “So-So” or “Okay”. \n\nI noticed that the lesser time we spent with our children, the more tendency we will overcompensate to cover our guilt. The older generation may not understand that.\n\nI know there are many views out there. I just want to say that I still know how to treat someone with hard love and violence but I choose not to. I think it was a quote from Kindness Diary- “Although life may always contain both darkness and light, ultimately when we open our eyes to the world around us, it is our choice to decide how we see it.”\n\nYes, this world can be cruel and harsh.

iagedd1,v0hbrp,"> # Letter of the week: Students and parents not showing teachers the respect they deserve\n\n> I remember my school days, when teachers could discipline students by any means necessary. I remember how students wouldn't even tell their parents when we got slapped, because our parents respected the fact that our teachers disciplined us.\n\n> We did not fear our teachers; we actually respected them. They made us the men and women we are today.\n\n> Sadly, I don't think this will apply to young people in the future, now that those disciplinary methods are no longer considered acceptable in class.\n\n> I have heard many stories from my teacher friends about students rolling their eyes at or shouting back at teachers, and being rude to them. I can't imagine this behaviour being tolerated by my teachers when I was in school.\n\n> Young people today learn from their parents, whether directly or indirectly, that it is all right to be disrespectful to their teachers.\n\n> They follow the examples of their parents, who talk to teachers and treat them as if they don't matter. I am appalled by the way parents treat teachers these days. Is this what Singapore has come to?\n\n> The authorities need to give teachers more protection. Parents should be warned that if they are disrespectful to teachers, they will be reprimanded.\n\n> If teachers are not protected, these incidents of students and their parents being rude to teachers will keep happening.

ialkkh1,v0hbrp,"Hi, I hope you are feeling good today. :)\n\nI cannot help to agree that I felt this animosity towards my parents when I was younger. They kept saying that they are doing the best for me but their actions contradicted. I cannot help to feel despair, anger which resulted in hate. I wished I could choose my parents. I blamed my unhappy childhood on them. I felt like i could not cry for them during their funerals.\n\nIn retrospect, I was a child who did not get much help processing what was going on. I was left to deal with this all alone and was expected to grow up. \n\nThis child is still inside me, it comes out once a while whenever I see children who acted mischievously like me. I would be hostile/mean to these kids and try to make them change. Then I realised that I see them in me and was trying to “help myself”. It was pretty messed up. \n\nBro, you have the right to feel the way you are now. But what I am saying is you will be carrying this huge mess of unprocessed feelings and it will produce thought and manifest in actions. I have completely no idea how that will affect you.\n\nI am now on a journey to forgive my parents. The most liberating moment was sitting down and telling my mother the day which hurt me the most and what she did. There was silence. She confessed she totally had no recollection and apologised if it hurt me. For 30 years, I kept that shit in me and expected her to remember! I cried a little and hugged her. I was glad I was able to let go of that. The funny thing was- it was not about her apology, rather the changed was within me, the “liberation”. My mother didn’t change, I accepted that too.\n\nYou must be wondering why did I start doing this? Because there are people I love and all these are really affecting me. I just want to grow and let go of the mask and armour I had developed over the years to protect myself… when I was child left to my own device to fend for myself. It’s a good armour. But I can do without it.\n\nTake care! :)",1653951744,t1_iajhs3x,/r/singapore/comments/v0hbrp/letter_of_the_week_students_and_parents_not/ialkkh1/

iaihq0k,v0e11t,">those food delivery apps take \~30% fee which is simply not sustainable for small stalls\n\nAnd people often forget that that's 30% out of the ""profit"" part of the sale. So if a plate of food would be 50% costs (groceries etc) and 50% towards their salary, then suddenly it's 50% to the regular costs, 30% to the service, and 20% to the salary.\n\nThat's 60% of their salary gone for every regular customer that try to support them by conveniently using their new digital service.\n\nIf they are currently at 100 customers for a certain period of time, they with the digital service now get 150 customers for the same period of time; with 25 regulars switching to using the new digital service that means:\n\nFirst their salary from regulars that show up and pay as usually drop to 75%.\n\nThen out of that other half of customers that use the digital service is 60% less; so that's 75 + (75 \* .4) = 105 total.\n\nSo that person is now making only 5% more money, but have to do 150% of the work that they used to do (which might be beyond what their small business can handle); and their costs are now actually higher because not only did they have to carry more (so maybe get something for that) but they also must have greater margins to cover great days vs bad day etc.\n\nAnd to top it all off these digital services sometimes withhold all money until the end of the next month before paying out, and they mercilessly remove any transactions that for some reason didn't go through.\n\nSo the business owner is doing 150% of their regular work for practically no extra profit, they take on a greater risk, and for up to two months they don't get any money at all for the digital sales. Aaaand since 50% of each plate is costs, and half the sales are digital they for these two months get zero salary for themselves. Aaaaaaaand if they are a digital success with more than 50% of the sales being digital it means that they personally would have to put cash into the business to cover the costs while they're getting no salary.\n\nSo even a success case would be no extra money, more risk, and without salary also practically running the business at a loss for two months.",1653888209,t1_iagbird,/r/singapore/comments/v0e11t/help_a_hawker_aunty_in_her_business/iaihq0k/

iai7kk7,v0e11t,"(Replying to myself here, because major edit otherwise.)\n\nI actually believe that there's a very good startup idea here.\n\nYou will always have these businesses that will essentially be outside of these technical support systems that are almost required today, and you will always have loyal customers that will want to do more to help.\n\nI think that a community service clearly run by those loyal customers could be a good thing.\n\nSo you have a community where a business is added, and that profile is similar to foursquare with mayors etc; and there you list things about that business. For instance you might list a service whereby someone ""manually"" go to a hawker to buy and deliver food to you. Or you list different social media profiles run by fans, and you get semi-official hashtags going so that the profile automatically include these posts. And you make sure to do good SEO for this profile.\n\nAnd you explain this to the business so you get official support and is allowed to put up a tag (NFC, QR, maybe BT-beacon) at that business.\n\n(I believe that this easily could be developed into a profitable startup, and even get government grants for supporting the community. It's not a business I'm in position to start and run, but I would love to in one way or another support such a project as a CTO or tech strategist etc.)\n\nEdit: Please add a comment if you're downvoting this, I would love the feedback.",1653881953,t1_iai1jmk,/r/singapore/comments/v0e11t/help_a_hawker_aunty_in_her_business/iai7kk7/

Or bring his friends and colleagues to eat at the hawker. \n\nAlso check first if the hawker wants to sign up for food delivery apps. You can only encourage them to try.\n\nIf the food is really great can ask for food reviewers to try it. Although the unpaid genuine hawker food reviewers won't immediately try a recommended food stall.
