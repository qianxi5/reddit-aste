iaj9vj7,v0yimw,"> # New ability tests expand pool of NSFs eligible for certain SAF roles\n\n> SINGAPORE - Lance Corporal Lau Kah Onn, 21, suffered from multiple kneecap dislocations in his teens while playing basketball in secondary school.\n\n> A history of injuries like his previously meant a blanket exemption from serving as a transport operator in national service, his current role at the Singapore Armed Forces' Transport Hub West.\n\n> But Lance Cpl Lau, who enlisted in May last year, is among a group of full-time national servicemen with certain limb conditions and past sports injuries who can now serve as transport operators.\n\n> This initiative is part of the SAF's push in recent years to deploy more soldiers in more meaningful roles, while maintaining safety and operational effectiveness.\n\n> This is being done by doing away with a binary mode of medically classifying soldiers into combat-fit and non-combat-fit, starting with transport operators in April last year.\n\n> To ensure the soldiers' safety and capacity to serve, trained SAF physiotherapists will evaluate the servicemen for their strength, range of motion and stability on a case-by-case basis.\n\n> This is done through ability tests - called functional assessment - that replicate the physical movements servicemen will need for specific roles, such as, in the case of transport operators, clambering on and off trucks.\n\n> The exercises used in the assessment for transport operators were developed by the Headquarters Army Medical Services, in consultation with physiotherapists and occupational therapists from Tan Tock Seng Hospital's National Driving Assessment and Rehabilitation Programme.\n\n> Upon passing the assessment, Lance Cpl Lau attended the same training as other transport operators who did not need the assessment and has been given the same duties.\n\n> He said he has no symptoms lingering from his injuries, other than the occasional stiffness, which does not affect his work.\n\n> The assessment helps optimise the deployment of every national serviceman by allowing servicemen of varying physical abilities to take on a wider range of operational roles.\n\n> Chief of Army Brigadier-General David Neo said in an interview last Wednesday (May 25) that the army will extend such functional assessments to other vocations and redesign new jobs.\n\n> This would translate into expanded deployment for 1,600 full-time national servicemen jobs across 89 vocations.\n\n> Since the assessment, which targets non-combat-fit servicemen with a Physical Employment Status (PES) of C and E, was introduced in April last year, SAF has increased its selection pool of potential transport operators by 7 per cent.\n\n> ""We are now able to look at the requirements of different jobs and say that it may be doable even though by the original PES system, you would not have been allowed to do so,"" said Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How, after visiting the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) School V at Kranji Camp II on Monday (May 30).\n\n> BMTC School V conducts basic military training for enlistees deemed non-combat-fit, such as Lance Cpl Lau.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653911602,t3_v0yimw,/r/singapore/comments/v0yimw/new_ability_tests_expand_pool_of_nsfs_eligible/iaj9vj7/

iaj8y32,v0ycbf,"> # Groomsman guilty of sexually assaulting bride on wedding night\n\n> SINGAPORE: After a night of drinking, a groomsman sexually assaulted the bride of his close friend in the bridal suite on the couple's wedding night.\n\n> The offender was convicted on Monday (May 30) after contesting two charges of sexual assault and using criminal force to outrage the woman's modesty at trial.\n\n> The identities of the offender and victim are protected by gag order. Details of the wedding, which took place in 2016, are not published as they could lead to identification of the parties involved.\n\n> The court heard that the victim and her husband have since divorced.\n\n> The offender, now in his 40s, was part of a group of groomsmen and bridesmaids who were invited to an after-party in the couple's bridal suite when the banquet ended.\n\n> Alcohol was available during the meal, and the group ordered and consumed more alcohol while in the suite.\n\n> Around 1am, the victim felt tired and left to shower and was alone in the bedroom while the group stayed in the living room.\n\n> The after-party ended at about 3am with everyone leaving except for the accused and victim's husband, who had fallen asleep in the living room.\n\n> Principal District Judge Victor Yeo said the main issues at trial were the facts of what had happened, and said that he believed the victim's testimony over the offender's.\n\n> VICTIM'S TESTIMONY\n\n> At trial, Deputy Public Prosecutors Ng Yiwen and Goh Yong Ngee argued that at about 6am, the victim woke up and felt she was being touched at her chest and private part.\n\n> She thought it was her husband and spoke to him, asking him to shower and sleep on the left side of the bed that she had left empty for him.\n\n> After each time she spoke, there was no response and the touching would momentarily stop before resuming.\n\n> The woman thought that the person might not be her husband as she felt the texture of jeans, which was not what he wore at the banquet.\n\n> However, she did not say anything as she did not think anyone besides her husband was in the bedroom with her.\n\n> After some time, she began to think that something was amiss and tried to look but the room was very dark and she could not see the person's face clearly.\n\n> The offender did not reply when she asked him to identify himself, and the victim became scared. Leaving the bedroom, she saw her husband in the living room and woke him up.\n\n> At that moment, the offender came out of the bedroom and started talking to the victim's husband. The victim saw that he was shirtless and wearing jeans.\n\n> She later confronted the offender and accused him of touching her.\n\n> The offender initially denied this, then later admitted to the victim's husband that he had touched her chest but not her private part.\n\n> The victim's husband told the offender to leave and the victim decided to make a police report.\n\n> OFFENDER'S TESTIMONY\n\n> Defence lawyers Edmond Pereira and Jessica Cheung argued that the offender believed he had woken up in his own bed at home.\n\n> He admitted to touching the victim's chest, saying that he had mistaken her for his wife. However, he denied sexually assaulting her.\n\n> The man claimed to have immediately retracted his hand when he heard the victim, which did not sound like his wife.\n\n> When he got out of bed and turned around, he said he was shocked to see that the person next to him was the victim.\n\n> He claimed that he went to the living room, where he woke the groom up and said he was sorry he had touched the victim's chest as he thought he was at home.\n\n> The man said he then left for home after he had put on his clothes and the groom told him he would settle the matter.\n\n> ""DESPERATE EXCUSE""\n\n> Judge Yeo said the offender's account of events was a ""desperate excuse"" conceived retroactively to explain his actions, and that his defence of mistaking the victim for his wife was ""unbelievable"".\n\n> If the offender believed he was at home, then he failed to explain why he deviated from his usual practice of sleeping on the floor instead of the bed if he had not showered, said the judge.\n\n> The offender's claim that the sounds he heard from the victim was also ""clearly a fabrication"" that differed from her evidence, said Judge Yeo.\n\n> Additionally, the man's behaviour with the groom in the living room after the incident was more consistent with guilt, and the offender was ""clearly trying to portray that he had owned up to his error immediately"".\n\n> In contrast, the victim was a credible and honest witness, whose account of events was ""unwavering"". It was also consistent and corroborated by evidence from her then husband, said Judge Yeo.\n\n> This made her evidence ""unusually convincing"", and meant the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt, said the judge.\n\n> The offender, who has a prior conviction for distributing uncensored films, will return to court for sentencing in July.\n\n> The punishment for sexually penetrating another person without consent is punishable with up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning.\n\n> The penalty for using criminal force to outrage a person's modesty is up to two years' jail, a fine, caning or any combination of these punishments.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653910948,t3_v0ycbf,/r/singapore/comments/v0ycbf/groomsman_guilty_of_sexually_assaulting_bride_on/iaj8y32/

iaj0tta,v0wok7,"> # Probation for teen who harassed train passengers by pretending to detonate bomb\n\n> SINGAPORE - A teenager who claimed to have a bomb in his bag while on an MRT train and pretended to detonate it by pressing imaginary buttons was sentenced to 21 months' probation on Monday (May 30).\n\n> He had pleaded guilty in court on March 24 to four charges for offences including harassment, theft and rioting.\n\n> The teen will have to undergo four months of intensive probation and 17 months of supervised probation, as well as performing 60 hours of community service.\n\n> His parents, who were present in court on Monday, are bonded $5,000 to ensure his good behaviour.\n\n> The boy cannot be identified as anyone below 18 is covered under the Children and Young Persons Act.\n\n> Deputy Public Prosecutor Jason Chua said in court documents that the teenager was on a train heading to Serangoon from Hougang with friends at around 8pm on Dec 26, 2019.\n\n> He was seated with his bag on his lap when he said loudly: ""Guys, inside my bag (is) the... bomb... So we're going to bomb the whole station, and everybody inside the train (is) going to die.""\n\n> He then put the sling bag under the train seat, covered his ears and shouted, ""Allahu Akbar"", an Arabic phrase that means ""God is greatest"".\n\n> Other passengers on the train heard him, and his antics were recorded and uploaded on social media platform Instagram.\n\n> In an unrelated incident, one of the teen's friends hatched a plan to steal a gold chain from a Hougang pawnshop, and the boy agreed to take part in the crime.\n\n> On Jan 16, 2020, he went to the pawnshop and asked to see its biggest gold chain. When he was handed an item priced at $7,455, he ran off with it. He left the chain in a nearby pavilion, and the friend picked it up about 15 minutes later.\n\n> The next day, the chain was sold at another pawnshop for about $6,500. The friend later gave the teenager $150.\n\n> Separately, the teenager and several other people ganged up to assault an 18-year-old boy in Hougang in the wee hours of May 2 last year.\n\n> After the attack, the victim went to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where he was found to have injuries including facial wounds.\n\n> For harassment, the offender could have been fined up to $5,000.\n\n> For theft in dwelling, he could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined.\n\n> For rioting, he could have been jailed for up to seven years and caned.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653904285,t3_v0wok7,/r/singapore/comments/v0wok7/probation_for_teen_who_harassed_train_passengers/iaj0tta/
