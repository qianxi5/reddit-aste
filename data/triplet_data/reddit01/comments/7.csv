iait355,v0v3rn,"> # Man fined S$1.16 million for subletting rented properties on AirBnB, HomeAway\n\n> SINGAPORE: A man was fined about S$1.16 million on Monday (May 30) for providing unauthorised short-term accommodation on platforms such as AirBnB and HomeAway.\n\n> Simon Chan Chai Wan, 57, leased 14 units and sublet them out for short-term accommodation. His girlfriend Zhao Jing, 43, was fined S$84,000 for aiding him.\n\n> The fine imposed on Chan is the largest amount that has been meted out for a person in Singapore for such offences, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said.\n\n> Chan and Zhao were both licensed real estate agents at the time, court documents showed. They were also the directors of two companies – HTM Solutions and HTM Management for certain periods between 2016 and 2018. Chan was also the former director of a company called SNS Infotech.\n\n> Court documents showed that Chan leased various private residences to provide short-term accommodation to both local and foreign guests through the three companies, according to court documents.\n\n> The 14 units were in areas such as River Valley Road, Orchard Road, Killiney Road, Robinson Road and Keppel Bay.\n\n> The transactions took place on various platforms, including AirBnB and HomeAway, which allow users to post listings for apartments or houses for short-term stays.\n\n> “(Chan) leased units for the purposes of subletting them out for short-term accommodation,” court documents said.\n\n> He also persuaded Zhao to enter into tenancy agreements with the owners of two of the units.\n\n> Throughout the tenancy period, Chan and Zhao did not inform the owners of the units that they were being sublet out for short-term accommodation. They knew that doing so was illegal, court documents showed.\n\n> Besides helping Chan rent two units as part of the scheme, Zhao also helped him to set up and manage host accounts on the AirBnB platform and to post listings for the units.\n\n> She registered the first host account on AirBnB sometime in 2016 under the name “Jing”, where she listed several units. She also managed guest reservations, answered enquiries and updated the calendar.\n\n> ""Without Zhao’s assistance, Chan would not have been able to carry out the STA operation. Chan took care of matters outside of the accounts, that is, the day-to-day running of the units,"" court documents said.\n\n> Investigations showed that Chan had illegally provided short-term accommodation at 14 premises from Jun 30, 2017 to July 2018. The total revenue that he obtained was S$1,254,907.78.\n\n> Zhao was paid S$4,000 monthly for helping him in the scheme. Between Jun 30, 2017 and Aug 3, 2018, she received an income of about S$52,000.\n\n> Chan pleaded guilty to nine charges under the Planning Act, with another five taken into consideration for sentencing.\n\n> Under URA's regulations, all private residential properties rented out for accommodation purposes are subject to a minimum stay duration of three consecutive months.\n\n> ""Property owners should also exercise due diligence to ensure that their properties are not used by their tenants for unauthorised purposes,"" said URA.\n\n> ""Unauthorised short-term accommodation with frequent turnover of transient guests not only changes the residential character of a property, but also causes dis-amenities to neighbouring residents.\n\n> ""URA will continue to take strong enforcement actions against short-term accommodation offenders, including property owners, tenants, agents and anyone found to have assisted in such illicit activities, in order to safeguard the interest of the community.""\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653897250,t3_v0v3rn,/r/singapore/comments/v0v3rn/man_fined_s116_million_for_subletting_rented/iait355/

iaiot40,v0u9ds,"SINGAPORE - Recent National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) graduates will be able to head to Britain to look for jobs under a new visa designed to give British businesses access to graduates from the world's top universities.  \nAccording to the British High Commission in Singapore, the United Kingdom's High Potential Individual (HPI) visa, which will be open to applicants from Monday (May 30), was introduced as part of a broader post-Brexit government strategy to make the country more globally competitive.  \nThe scheme offers visas to people who completed a degree from top universities outside the UK within the last five years.  \nNUS and NTU appear on the British Home Office's Top Global Universities list, which also includes Harvard, Stanford, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, Canada's University of Toronto, Peking University and Tsinghua University in China, and the University of Tokyo in Japan.  \nInternational students in British universities are not included in the scheme, as they come under the UK graduate visa scheme, which allows those who have completed a degree within the UK to stay for at least two years after graduating.  \nTo be included in the HPI visa list, the universities must have been placed in the Top 50 positions in at least two of the following world rankings: Times Higher Education World University Rankings, Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings and The Academic Ranking of World Universities by Shanghai Jiao Tong University.  \nIn the latest Times Higher Education world ranking, NUS was placed 21st, while NTU was placed 46th.  \nBesides having a bachelor's, master's, or a PhD from one of the universities on the list, applicants also have to meet English language requirements and have at least £1,270 (S$2,200) available in cash.  \nApplicants need not have a job offer to qualify for the HPI visa. After arriving in the UK, visa holders with a bachelor's or master's degree will have two years to look for a job, while those with a PhD will be given three years to look for jobs. Visa holders can look for jobs in any industry.  \nMr David Leong, who heads recruitment firm PeopleWorldwide Consulting, said that local graduates would find the visa scheme attractive, and added that it should be seen as ""brain gain"" in the long run rather than ""brain drain"".  \n""It is good for young people to go out into the world and gain exposure and experience in vibrant economies. In some industries such as finance, there are many exciting opportunities in London.""  \nHe said British firms will be keen on local graduates as they are well trained and have good work ethic. They also have skills, such as the ability to speak Mandarin and other Asian languages, which will give them an edge.  \nHe added: ""I say it will be 'brain gain', because I do believe that after a few years, they are likely to come back home. I have seen this with many I have headhunted for jobs. They want to come back here once they are married and start a family, for practical reasons such as their children's education. And they come back with good experience and skills, including leadership skills.""  \nRecent NUS law graduate Desmond Lee said he was likely to apply for the visa later this year.  \n""I do corporate law and I am interested in going into fintech because I see many opportunities there. It will be great if I can go to London for a few months, network and look for a job there, instead of trying to do it from here. I could start with a temporary position, while I look for permanent opportunities,"" he said.  \nNUS president Tan Eng Chye said he was heartened that NUS graduates are eligible for the new visa and called it a strong validation of the global competitiveness of NUS graduates.  \nHe added: ""We will continue to champion interdisciplinary teaching and learning to nurture highly skilled, adaptable and resilient graduates who can make positive contributions as global citizens of the future.""  \nNTU's deputy provost (education) Tan Ooi Kiang said NTU's inclusion in the scheme opens up a world of opportunities for its recent graduates to develop their employment and career prospects in the fifth-largest economy in the world.  \nHe added: ""NTU graduates will be well placed to reap the benefits of this new scheme, having been exposed to various overseas offerings as part of the NTU experience, where our students get the opportunity to go on overseas internships and immersion programmes to expand their horizons and develop global perspectives.""  \nBut Associate Professor Jason Tan from the National Institute of Education questioned the qualification criteria used for the visa, which leaves out graduates from other Singapore universities.  \n""The students from the other local universities have similar, and in some disciplines, even better job outcomes. But because their universities do not appear in the top 50 list, they are left out.  \n""There are many good universities in Singapore and around the world that will not do well in these rankings because they are not large, comprehensive universities with high research output, which is given significant weightage in these rankings.""",1653893597,t3_v0u9ds,/r/singapore/comments/v0u9ds/nus_ntu_grads_can_go_job_hunting_in_britain_under/iaiot40/

iaiodmw,v0u6us,"SINGAPORE - Recent National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) graduates will be able to head to Britain to look for jobs under a new visa designed to give British businesses access to graduates from the world's top universities.  \nAccording to the British High Commission in Singapore, the United Kingdom's High Potential Individual (HPI) visa, which will be open to applicants from Monday (May 30), was introduced as part of a broader post-Brexit government strategy to make the country more globally competitive.  \nThe scheme offers visas to people who completed a degree from top universities outside the UK within the last five years.  \nNUS and NTU appear on the British Home Office's Top Global Universities list, which also includes Harvard, Stanford, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, Canada's University of Toronto, Peking University and Tsinghua University in China, and the University of Tokyo in Japan.  \nInternational students in British universities are not included in the scheme, as they come under the UK graduate visa scheme, which allows those who have completed a degree within the UK to stay for at least two years after graduating.  \nTo be included in the HPI visa list, the universities must have been placed in the Top 50 positions in at least two of the following world rankings: Times Higher Education World University Rankings, Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings and The Academic Ranking of World Universities by Shanghai Jiao Tong University.  \nIn the latest Times Higher Education world ranking, NUS was placed 21st, while NTU was placed 46th.  \nBesides having a bachelor's, master's, or a PhD from one of the universities on the list, applicants also have to meet English language requirements and have at least £1,270 (S$2,200) available in cash.  \nApplicants need not have a job offer to qualify for the HPI visa. After arriving in the UK, visa holders with a bachelor's or master's degree will have two years to look for a job, while those with a PhD will be given three years to look for jobs. Visa holders can look for jobs in any industry.  \nMr David Leong, who heads recruitment firm PeopleWorldwide Consulting, said that local graduates would find the visa scheme attractive, and added that it should be seen as ""brain gain"" in the long run rather than ""brain drain"".  \n""It is good for young people to go out into the world and gain exposure and experience in vibrant economies. In some industries such as finance, there are many exciting opportunities in London.""  \nHe said British firms will be keen on local graduates as they are well trained and have good work ethic. They also have skills, such as the ability to speak Mandarin and other Asian languages, which will give them an edge.  \nHe added: ""I say it will be 'brain gain', because I do believe that after a few years, they are likely to come back home. I have seen this with many I have headhunted for jobs. They want to come back here once they are married and start a family, for practical reasons such as their children's education. And they come back with good experience and skills, including leadership skills.""  \nRecent NUS law graduate Desmond Lee said he was likely to apply for the visa later this year.  \n""I do corporate law and I am interested in going into fintech because I see many opportunities there. It will be great if I can go to London for a few months, network and look for a job there, instead of trying to do it from here. I could start with a temporary position, while I look for permanent opportunities,"" he said.  \nNUS president Tan Eng Chye said he was heartened that NUS graduates are eligible for the new visa and called it a strong validation of the global competitiveness of NUS graduates.  \nHe added: ""We will continue to champion interdisciplinary teaching and learning to nurture highly skilled, adaptable and resilient graduates who can make positive contributions as global citizens of the future.""  \nNTU's deputy provost (education) Tan Ooi Kiang said NTU's inclusion in the scheme opens up a world of opportunities for its recent graduates to develop their employment and career prospects in the fifth-largest economy in the world.  \nHe added: ""NTU graduates will be well placed to reap the benefits of this new scheme, having been exposed to various overseas offerings as part of the NTU experience, where our students get the opportunity to go on overseas internships and immersion programmes to expand their horizons and develop global perspectives.""  \nBut Associate Professor Jason Tan from the National Institute of Education questioned the qualification criteria used for the visa, which leaves out graduates from other Singapore universities.  \n""The students from the other local universities have similar, and in some disciplines, even better job outcomes. But because their universities do not appear in the top 50 list, they are left out.  \n""There are many good universities in Singapore and around the world that will not do well in these rankings because they are not large, comprehensive universities with high research output, which is given significant weightage in these rankings.""",1653893249,t3_v0u6us,/r/singapore/comments/v0u6us/nus_ntu_grads_can_go_job_hunting_in_britain_under/iaiodmw/

iais82b,v0twbw,Uber doesn't need to come back because they have a stake in grab.

Whether the grab/uber model should command such high valuation while selling themselves as being profit super center by killing all other competitors through sheer capital dominance to become a monopoly is the sketchy aspect of Grab/Uber (Also softbank with its many investments). \n\nThere is a good reason why taxi services were all hyperlocal businesses in the past. Nothing about the economics of such business has changed. At its core, Grab/Uber introduced a terrific replacement to people flagging down cabs on the road and calling taxi call centres for advance bookings, nothing much more at this point. \n\nIn essence, what people want is for price to being more reasonable and drivers wants to maximize their takings.
