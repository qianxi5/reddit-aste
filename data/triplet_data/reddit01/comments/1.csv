The study, however, claims that the minimum amount of paid leave offered in Singapore was seven days.\n\n> Bern in Switzerland, and Helsinki in Finland, were ranked second and third for work-life balance.\n\n> Data used for the study was acquired from sources such as international organisations, non-profit organisations, open access datasets, public surveys and crowdsourcing platforms, Kisi stated.\n\n> Top image by Steve Ding/Unsplash\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1654007564,t3_v1rmvz,/r/singapore/comments/v1rmvz/spore_ranked_worlds_best_city_to_work_from_home/iao0gbi/

iaqktg4,v1quob,"With regards to pad-work with strikes from pad-holder, I think this short [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paCHXpVCBAA) would give you an idea of how intense it might get depending on the goal of the session, this one being fight team selection where durability and mettle would be sorely tested. It is possible to take the short hard edge of the pad to your face, something akin to receiving a stiff jab. Personal experience wise at a previous gym, I have been kneed twice, as well as teeped across the mat (i'm really light, so I tend to take involuntary flight...) during padwork. I didn't really notice if I got any bruises, but the strikes certainly knocked the wind out of me of a couple of seconds. Then I simply got back up and resume the padwork session.\n\n*The one thing about MT training is that progression of training is a very subtle thing, and seldom spelt out verbally. Instructors would observe their batch of students and remember those who have shown potential. Then one day, they would test out the student with a pad-strike and see their reaction. Students just wanting to clock a fitness session would be totally spooked by the strike and it really shows on their face, then the instructor would revert back to not testing that student so much. On the other hand, if you actually took the strike in your stride and so much as react with a grin on your face, your instructor would smile back, and yes from then on, your padwork sessions will be... a little more interesting. It really is that subtle.*\n\n**However, this reply isn't meant to throw shade on the Lena's account, but more about sharing how a padholder may evolve the padwork session to simulate fight conditions.** The investigation would likely shed more light on the specific details of that hard session, such as: what was the exact nature of that physical assessment, did the coach harbour any ill will, accounts from 3rd party observations where available, were the strikes thrown outside of the actual padwork session (?!), etc.\n\nHope this can be resolved definitively, as I really want to see our MT athletes shine on the global stage without getting mired by such incidents.",1654049299,t1_iao17uc,/r/singapore/comments/v1quob/singapore_muay_thai_athlete_alleges_she_was/iaqktg4/

ianpqnz,v1pun4,"> # Section 377A should not be repealed now: Singapore Archbishop William Goh\n\n> Singapore should not repeal Section 377A, which criminalises sex between men, under present circumstances, Archbishop William Goh said on Tuesday (18 September).\n\n> In a pastoral letter posted on the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore’s website, he also wrote that he would not object to a repeal of the law “if it were merely aimed at removing all potential criminal penalties against homosexuals”.\n\n> “However, until and unless Parliament puts in place a formulation that more perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the law, guaranteeing the protection of the rights of the majority who favour the traditional family, and that no further demands be made to legalise same-sex unions, same-sex adoption of babies, surrogacy, or to criminalise those who do not support the homosexual lifestyle, I am of the view that S377A should not be repealed under the present circumstances,” he added.\n\n> The debate over Section 377A was reignited in recent days after the Indian Supreme Court’s decision earlier this month to strike down a similar law and a top Singapore diplomat urged a challenge to the gay sex ban.\n\n> Petitions have since been started by activists on both sides of the divide, with religious groups weighing in, and a deejay filing a fresh legal challenge. Most Singaporeans still support keeping the ban, a survey showed.\n\n> Minister for Law and Home Affairs K. Shanmugam had said that any decision on 377A is a matter for Parliament. Depending on the legislation, public opinion is “often relevant” during policy making in Parliament, he added.\n\n> Education Minister Ong Ye Kung has also weighed in on the issue, stressing that there is no discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community “at work, housing (and) education” in Singapore.\n\n> In his message, Archbishop Goh touched on the dilemma he is facing over the debate.\n\n> “On one hand, I feel the struggles and pains of those with same-sex attraction, who sincerely love God and desire to live up to His divine plan for humanity,” he wrote.\n\n> “On the other hand, I share the anxieties and fears of those who subscribe to the traditional and scriptural views of marriage and family, that repealing S377A would lead the country down a slippery slope,” he added.\n\n> Nonetheless, he is of the view that Section 377A should not be repealed because “by accepting homosexual acts as a social norm, the dreadful consequences for the stability of our families, the well-being of our children, and the risks to the common good will be long-term and irreversible”.\n\n> He ended his letter with: “Looking at the dire consequences for countries which normalised same-sex unions and the ramifications that followed, may we not repeat the mistake that others have made! I pray that we will not walk the slippery path of no return.”\n\n> Related Stories:\n\n> K Shanmugam answers queries on Section 377A by church leaders at briefing\n\n> After India Ruling, Activist Challenges Section 377 in Singapore\n\n> Thousands back petition to maintain Singapore’s gay sex ban\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1654002363,t3_v1pun4,/r/singapore/comments/v1pun4/section_377a_should_not_be_repealed_now_singapore/ianpqnz/
