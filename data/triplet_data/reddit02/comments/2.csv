iadzryn,v02qj1,"> # Singaporeans should continue to wear masks if unwell even after Covid-19 is over: PM Lee\n\n> TOKYO - Singaporeans should continue to wear masks outdoors if they feel unwell even after the Covid-19 pandemic is over, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday (May 27).\n\n> Mr Lee, who is on his first visit to Japan since 2019, observed that the Japanese are ""very, very conscientious"".\n\n> ""It is a good habit and I think it is a longstanding instinct,"" he noted.\n\n> He added that it has long been a practice in Japan even before Covid-19 that ""if you are sick, you go out with a mask and protect other people from yourself"".\n\n> And as such, even as Japan has not imposed any punitive measures on those who do not wear masks throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, PM Lee said: ""There is no compulsion, but there is a lot of social expectation. And I think that these are some of the instincts which we should pick up.""\n\n> PM Lee added that, even after Covid-19, when masks are no longer essential or compulsory outdoors: ""I hope that people will be conscious of it and if you are not well, please put on a mask to go outdoors.\n\n> ""Now that we have all done it and we have gotten used to it, it does not feel so strange anymore.""\n\n> PM Lee also expressed hopes that Japan will open up for tourism even wider soon.\n\n> Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Thursday that Japan will accept leisure tourists, starting June 10, from 98 regions including the United States, China, South Korea and Singapore.\n\n> But they must be part of guided tour groups, where guides will carefully monitor their activities during the trip. No Covid-19 tests or quarantine will be needed for these tourists upon entry, regardless of their vaccination status.\n\n> This goes beyond an ongoing trial that involves 50 people in small group tours from the US, Australia, Thailand and Singapore.\n\n> PM Lee said that he had told Mr Kishida during their bilateral meeting on Thursday that many Singaporeans were ""very anxious"" to visit Japan for the food, skiing, scenery and religious tourism, and that flights would be full as and when Japan opens up.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653795015,t3_v02qj1,/r/singapore/comments/v02qj1/singaporeans_should_continue_to_wear_masks_if/iadzryn/

iadnkan,v00vz9,"> # ‘The lack of humanity eats away at you’: Frontline workers spill out bad encounters on the job\n\n> SINGAPORE: Not in the least bit surprised. That was how Bryan Loo felt after reading about the driver who pushed a security guard with his Bentley to get into Red Swastika School earlier this year.\n\n> “It’s par for the course,” he said. “This one incident gets published, but I’m pretty sure there are 20 to 30 other instances that go unpublished.”\n\n> The 61-year-old driver and his son, who allegedly owns the Bentley, were charged this month in connection with the incident.\n\n> When Loo, 36, was a school security officer between 2019 and 2020, there was also one couple who wanted to drive into the school he was at, and they did not want to explain why.\n\n> “They could’ve said, ‘My child is sick’ or ‘I have an appointment with the principal’ — anything at all,” said Loo, who told the couple that requiring school visitors to have a valid reason for entering was the Education Ministry’s policy.\n\n> But the couple got only “more belligerent”. “At one point, because this was a Catholic school, they said, ‘Do you know that I know the Archbishop personally?’” Loo recounted. They also wanted to take down his particulars.\n\n> He had to bite back a sarcastic reply and eventually let them through because they kept inching their car forward. But he ran to the front office to tell the staff about this couple who refused to give a reason for their visit.\n\n> On the job at schools for a year, he faced other unreasonable people as well, mostly parents, he told CNA Insider in a Heavy Duty podcast episode featuring frontline workers who see the dark side of human nature at work.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653787934,t3_v00vz9,/r/singapore/comments/v00vz9/the_lack_of_humanity_eats_away_at_you_frontline/iadnkan/

Are these service staff barricading themselves from the negative energy they face every single day? (I'm give service staff more benefit of a doubt than customers, most of the time..)\n\nMy reflections on this is that our local education, being based on meritocracy, will easily translate into 'some are better than others' attitude, which flows into our culture. It takes a aware and compassionate mind to understand that meritocracy at work and school does not translate into lording over others.\n\nMy takeaway is that hopefully everyone tries to be compassionate. A bad customer might be having the stomachache of his life and hence is feeling irate, or a service staff might have had someone dear in hospital hence having the shittest day.\n\nI hope everyone can agree or realize that even( if you are a CEO), we will all have someone we need to answer or pander to, and it sucks if this person is not very nice.\nWe all have had bad days as well and our days get brighter when someone shows us kindness.\nI might be idealistic but I feel kindness makes the world go round..Pay it forward, and 千里之路，始与足下。\n\nHopefully someone brings a smile to your face today, and you can pay that smile forward. ❤️",1653818000,t1_iaeg90d,/r/singapore/comments/v00vz9/the_lack_of_humanity_eats_away_at_you_frontline/iaessc1/
