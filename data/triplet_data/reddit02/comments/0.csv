iaetl2e,v082mo,"> # Free kids' activities in Singapore for June school holidays\n\n> SINGAPORE - Going out and about with the kids during the June school holidays does not mean you have to burn a hole in your pocket.\n\n> Singapore has plenty of free attractions and activities which allow you to engage your children and bond as a family too.\n\n> The Straits Times speaks to parents to suss out ideas on where to go.\n\n> 1. Go on a nature trail\n\n> Nine-year-old Zachary Wong and his sisters Riley, seven, and Abby, three, love exploring the outdoors.\n\n> Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Lower Peirce Reservoir Park and MacRitchie Nature Trail are among the green spaces they have visited. They have a scrapbook with photos and details of the animals they have encountered.\n\n> ""Spotting wildlife is always very fun and exciting for children,"" says their mum Fynn Sor, creator of Happy Tot Shelf, an educational website.\n\n> Before entering the parks, they would read the information boards put up by the National Parks Board, which highlight the flora and fauna they can look out for.\n\n> ""It becomes a game of who can find them first,"" says Ms Sor.\n\n> Her family either visits the parks in the morning and leaves by 11am before it gets too hot, or after 4pm, when it is cooler.\n\n> How does she get her kids to cooperate and walk?\n\n> Going on nature trails can be challenging for young children, she acknowledges.\n\n> Her advice is to keep the first few trips short and simple. For beginners, she recommends Pasir Ris Park Mangrove Boardwalk, where her family has spotted mangrove tree crabs and mudskippers. ""It has a proper pathway and is a lot more comfortable for kids to walk,"" she adds.\n\n> If your children get tired, it is okay to cut short the visit. ""If they want to leave after half an hour, that's fine. We can go back another day,"" she says with a laugh.\n\n> ""When they get used to nature walks and their fitness and endurance levels increase, they can explore more adventurous places like Sungei Buloh.""\n\n> 2. Play in nature\n\n> Many nature parks here incorporate playgrounds. The Singapore Botanic Gardens, for instance, is home to two fun zones - Jacob Ballas Children's Garden and Como Adventure Grove.\n\n> These are excellent settings for kids to be introduced to nature.\n\n> Ms Farhana Mohamed Hassan, senior infant educarer at PCF Sparkletots Preschool, says the environment piques children's curiosity and encourages them to delve deeper about nature.\n\n> Her three kids - Muhammad Shauqy, seven, Nur Ashalina, five, and Nur Airis Lana, three - love to hang out at Jurong Lake Gardens.\n\n> They enjoy its Forest Ramble playground, which has 13 adventure stations, as well as its Clusia Cove water play area.\n\n> ""Spending time out creates a very special family bonding that you will not get from sitting around at home and watching TV together,"" she says.\n\n> 3. Hit the neighbourhood playgrounds\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653818714,t3_v082mo,/r/singapore/comments/v082mo/free_kids_activities_in_singapore_for_june_school/iaetl2e/
iaeq030,v07d6i,"> # Chess: Tin Jingyao set to become Singapore's youngest Grandmaster at 21\n\n> SINGAPORE - Fresh from winning two SEA Games medals in Vietnam earlier this month, Singapore's top-ranked chess player Tin Jingyao is set to become the nation's fifth and youngest Grandmaster after more sterling performances in the May 23-29 Hanoi GM Chess Tournament.\n\n> The 21-year-old won six of his first seven rounds and drew with Filipino Paulo Bersamina on Saturday (May 28) to meet the criteria to become a Grandmaster, pending ratification by the International Chess Federation (Fide).\n\n> To score the three norms to become a Grandmaster, the highest rank in the sport, a player has to participate in norm tournaments that have at least three Grandmasters from different countries, nine rounds, and a time control that is at least 120 minutes.\n\n> The player must also have a 2,600 Elo performance rating for these tournaments, and cross the 2,500 Fide rating.\n\n> Tin's first Grandmaster norm came in 2015 when he won the Asean Under-20 tournament which also gave him the direct International Master title. He earned his second Grandmaster at the recently concluded SEA Games.\n\n> ""I'm really happy with my performance... I did not expect to win six out of the first seven games and many even with the black pieces,"" said Tin in an Instagram post by Singapore Chess Federation vice-president Kevin Goh, who is the Republic's fourth Grandmaster.\n\n> ""This event has given me some good confidence in my own abilities, calculation and openings. I think in terms of level of play, it's probably my best event yet.""\n\n> Ranked 705th among the world's active players, Tin added that he aims to finish the ongoing tournament well and work on his ratings.\n\n> The five-time national champion will next compete at the Copthorne Waterfront Prof Lim Kok Ann Grandmaster invitational during the June 12-19 Singapore Chess Festival before leading the national team at the World Chess Olympiad in Chennai, India from July 28 to Aug 10.\n\n> Tin's impending promotion is another milestone in his meteoric rise since he picked up chess at eight after discovering the game online while using the computer at his aunt's house.\n\n> He was just 10 when he and 21 other enthusiasts simultaneously played (and lost to) Russian chess legend and former world champion Garry Kasparov in an event at the Serangoon Gardens Country Club, where he earned the praise of the former world No. 1 for his moves and for being the last player standing.\n\n> At the Hanoi SEA Games, Tin claimed silver in the men's rapid chess and bronze in the men's standard individual.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",1653815468,t3_v07d6i,/r/singapore/comments/v07d6i/chess_tin_jingyao_set_to_become_singapores/iaeq030/

iaesx15,v062zu,"Singaporean living permanently in UK after making the move there straight after graduating from a local U 3-4 years ago. \n\nIf salary is ones' main motivation for moving then you'll likely be disappointed when you make the move. Ebtry level or FTSE 100 grad schemes are nothing spectacular compared to what you have in SG in my personal opinion. \n\nIf its just for the few years of experience and seeing what's out there then by all means.\n\nThere's pros and cons of the move so whoever is interested needs to weigh it out what you are giving up and gaining in the process. Here is my own take:\n\n+ Better work life balance (I do the normal 9-5 and have never OT. Though it may be industry/company dependent)\n\n+ More space for myself as an introvert - I used to live on the fringes of London (Zone 5) and apart from days where I had to go into the office, I really could get by with seeing probably just 10-20 people each day. That really gave me a lot more ""space"" to myself to disconnect from everything. I've just recently move out of London to a city with a population just under 100k so if anything it has left me even more disconnected from the throngs of crowd when I want to. \n\n+ I've been in a fortunate position to be a homeowner (freehold detached house) before I hit my 30s which I don't think I'd have been able to achieve even if I slogged my entire life in SG. There are a lot of attractive places if one is willing to look outside of London. \n\n- Tax - its been said enough here so you'll notice it when you make the move, you are taxed more for more things. I try to focus more on things I can control by increasing my income (I've doubled it in 2 years) to look beyond that but again it depends on your industry and job function. \n\n- Not a path to settlement - this scheme doesn't allow for that so your best bet is to get converted to a proper sponsorship visa that allows you to get settlement status if you intend to stay in UK for the foreseeable future. \n\n- Food - if you don't cook its going to be a painful experience for your wallet if you eat out everyday on the high streets. There's no hawker culture. \n\n- Safety - I don't really head out much at night. It was never my thing in SG so it works out for me here. If you like your parties and clubs at night, just go at it with some mates and try not to go at it alone. Some parts of London/UK are known to be dodgier than the others and so it's all about risk management. Don't take safety for granted in UK like you did in SG. \n\n- Forming new social circles. Can be a + or - depending on how you see it. I've basically had to form up new social circles when I moved so my circle of close friends is definitely smaller than what it used to be in SG which is fine for an introvert like me but may not be so for others especially if you don't make acquaintances that well.\n\nNot limited to everything but just some of things I can think offhand for myself personally!",1653818120,t3_v062zu,/r/singapore/comments/v062zu/nus_ntu_grads_can_go_job_hunting_in_britain_under/iaesx15/

And then? Radio silence. Borders effectively sealed for 2 years and counting with no effective increase in headcount of financial talent or easing of corporate tax/inheritance tax/income tax/foreigner-friendly policies, etc. How to attract talent without sweeping structural reform and mindset shift? If anything it has gone in the opposite direction due to Covid.\n\nSingapore is currently too comfortable for most average Singaporeans. The truly extraordinary and brightest may venture out and thrive but unless PAP doubles down on their disastrous FT policies yet again, I think a lot are content to stay put as BTO and MRT infrastructure projects gradually get back on track along with other fluff enhancements like MBS expansion, Sentosa renewal, Changi T5, Greater Southern Waterfront, HSR 2.0?, etc. Especially with the tightening of EP requirements once again this upcoming September.",1653812232,t1_iael6bv,/r/singapore/comments/v062zu/nus_ntu_grads_can_go_job_hunting_in_britain_under/iaemfjn/
