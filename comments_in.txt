Have been in a place with plenty of soldier in transits. All I can day is alot of people just straight up don't want to do anything cos ahem forced to do 2 years.

"> # New ability tests expand pool of NSFs eligible for certain SAF roles\n\n> SINGAPORE - Lance Corporal Lau Kah Onn, 21, suffered from multiple kneecap dislocations in his teens while playing basketball in secondary school.\n\n> A history of injuries like his previously meant a blanket exemption from serving as a transport operator in national service, his current role at the Singapore Armed Forces' Transport Hub West.\n\n> But Lance Cpl Lau, who enlisted in May last year, is among a group of full-time national servicemen with certain limb conditions and past sports injuries who can now serve as transport operators.\n\n> This initiative is part of the SAF's push in recent years to deploy more soldiers in more meaningful roles, while maintaining safety and operational effectiveness.\n\n> This is being done by doing away with a binary mode of medically classifying soldiers into combat-fit and non-combat-fit, starting with transport operators in April last year.\n\n> To ensure the soldiers' safety and capacity to serve, trained SAF physiotherapists will evaluate the servicemen for their strength, range of motion and stability on a case-by-case basis.\n\n> This is done through ability tests - called functional assessment - that replicate the physical movements servicemen will need for specific roles, such as, in the case of transport operators, clambering on and off trucks.\n\n> The exercises used in the assessment for transport operators were developed by the Headquarters Army Medical Services, in consultation with physiotherapists and occupational therapists from Tan Tock Seng Hospital's National Driving Assessment and Rehabilitation Programme.\n\n> Upon passing the assessment, Lance Cpl Lau attended the same training as other transport operators who did not need the assessment and has been given the same duties.\n\n> He said he has no symptoms lingering from his injuries, other than the occasional stiffness, which does not affect his work.\n\n> The assessment helps optimise the deployment of every national serviceman by allowing servicemen of varying physical abilities to take on a wider range of operational roles.\n\n> Chief of Army Brigadier-General David Neo said in an interview last Wednesday (May 25) that the army will extend such functional assessments to other vocations and redesign new jobs.\n\n> This would translate into expanded deployment for 1,600 full-time national servicemen jobs across 89 vocations.\n\n> Since the assessment, which targets non-combat-fit servicemen with a Physical Employment Status (PES) of C and E, was introduced in April last year, SAF has increased its selection pool of potential transport operators by 7 per cent.\n\n> ""We are now able to look at the requirements of different jobs and say that it may be doable even though by the original PES system, you would not have been allowed to do so,"" said Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How, after visiting the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) School V at Kranji Camp II on Monday (May 30).\n\n> BMTC School V conducts basic military training for enlistees deemed non-combat-fit, such as Lance Cpl Lau.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

I think you're slightly exaggerating by saying a class 4 license will pull families out of financial struggles. The lost income and time of NS is much more than the cost of getting a class 4 license. At best it might help alleviate some of the financial distress NS causes.#### #### ####[]

"Our surveillance drones already suck donkey balls. BRC’s/C4I RSTA coys have man-portable UAVs as part of their estab, but most units don’t fly the damn thing during exercises (when airspace clearance is granted) because the damn thing is broken more than half of the time. It was damn funny seeing Perry Lim fly all the way up to Thailand to witness the UAV team in action during 16C4I’s ATEC, only for the plane to not fly.\n\nAlso, there *used* to be a TUAV coy within C4I units which flew an even larger UAV with an even longer loiter time, but that shit was always broken. It got so bad that the TUAV coy was absorbed into Bn HQ for reservist. If our surveillance drones are this bad, I can’t imagine any hypothetical attack drones working any better (unless we buy from other more established manufacturers as opposed to the usual ST crap)."#### #### ####[]

This is really an unprecedented lowering of physical standards. When they removed a few IPPT stations that was still reasonable - sit and reach is not exactly a key soldier skill. But now they're making people who have suffered multiple kneecap dislocations serve in combat support. In wartime these people will be very close to the front lines.

"Forcing the shrinking pool of enlistees into more dangerous and unsuitable roles is short sighted and not a long term solution to meet operational needs. Enlistees need to be trained from scratch over and over. In cases of sergeants and officers, they spend almost half their service being trained. And if you set the standard of being fully trained properly - at full, tested battalion level readiness - conscripts are only fully trained near the end of their NS service. After which they forget a lot of things.\n\nThe only options are to expand the pool of enlistees by including women, or expand the pool of already trained soldiers by increasing the number of regulars."#### #### ####[]

Don't have here as well.\n\nDon't really have the means to get it currently but definitely thinking about it for the future.#### #### ####[]
"I told my girlfriend that I use onlyfans and she got furious, not sure why"#### #### ####[]
"Living without the option of AC is honestly crippling. Like not having a washing machine at home or dryer for some. Using the shitty default wifi router provided instead of installing lan cables. Insisting to use a corded vaccum that costs as much as a Dyson. It just doesn't make sense. Sure, electricity isn't cheap but saving that reachable sum of money just seems a little pointless at the comfort and/or time saved it could have given you to improve your life to potentially get ahead in life to earn enough to afford these creature comforts.\n\nOf course, if you wanna save the earth, go ahead. But I am no expert at it so until they invent a green AC alternative, I don't see any other way to stay cool when needed without harming the environment."#### #### ####[]
">I've been seeing a lot of ""weather too hot, no ac"" replies on r/sg lately\n\nGotta keep in mind, people with AC aren't going to be posting ""weather too hot, lucky I got AC"", so your perception might be skewed by the number of comments complaining about no AC."#### #### ####[]

"I can live without a car but I cannot live without AC. My household use AC almost 24x7, at least 2 out of 4 units. I only switch off to do cleaning (once a week) and self servicing (once a month). I'm paying 160\~180 electricity bill for 2 years now. \n. \n4 years ago, my AC broke down during very hot April, while I have visiting family in my home. it is under full warranty but repair will take about \~15 days. I SOS to all my friends, one of them connected me with very friendly Aircon uncle, who come and install 2 x used Window Casement Aircons in the same day (for about $600). I used them for 20 days and sell them back to this same uncle (for $360), who come and uninstall them again. For the whole process, I only spent S$240 for 3 weeks for 2 rooms. (Beats any hotel.) \n. \nSo for the people who are having broken AC and suffering, go for 2nd hand casement AC rental solution while waiting a long time for repair."#### #### ####[]

Didn’t turn on my AC for so long that it broke down. Repairman advised to turn it on at least once every 6 months. \n\nRight now it’s broken again due to inactivity. Lol#### #### ####[]
"I chose not to install AC partly because I wanted to do my part to reduce carbon footprint, even if it is insignificant.\n\nNowadays, my windows are always opened; installed insect netting to prevent bugs from sneaking in - at least the ones that are larger than the holes of the net.

"Don't have it as a matter of principle. Everyone in the family is a strong believer of climate change and all these aircons will only accelerate the problem. Individual action is frankly useless when it comes to the climate and you can't fight the tragedy of the commons, but at least I think it gives us the right to talk about doing our parts for the environment.\n\nWe have our ways to cope with the heat, like fans which are more power-efficient than AC, and a fridge full of cold water bottles that are just so shiok right now. \#hydrohomies"#### #### ####[]
"secondary question, what temperature do you guys set your aircon to? i think even 27-28 degC is good enough in this weather imo"#### #### ####[]

i wanted to comment this but was sure gna get downvoted because people are too used growing up with ac. is sure can one. no ac of course will sweat but its definitely bearable#### #### ####[]
smart... once my bedroom aircon broke down and i was sleeping in the living room for 2 weeks.#### #### ####[]
Wow you sound like one of those that if aircon cease to exist you will simply migrate#### #### ####[]
"Don’t listen to that advice, it’s what big aircon do to con the sheeple into using their services. \n\nBoycott big aircon, go individual creators like onlyfans. \n\n/s"#### #### ####[]
"I agree too, but you must convince my stubborn boomer parents to acquiesce then.\n\nWe have the money, it's their mindset that's the problem."#### #### ####[]
"Very admirable, respect"#### #### ####[]
"I don't even mind the temp, it's the humidity. Remove that and it's all good (enough)"#### #### ####[]
"I think you'll get a range of answers because there's a few factors that affect the comfortable temp like your AC BTU, whether you've serviced your AC, size of room AC is in, location of your house in SG, whether you get direct sun and wind breeze etc.\n\nfwiw we sleep under a comforter and a quilt in our master bedroom with the AC set to dry mode"#### #### ####[]
I’m a guy so 22 minimum with this heat. 27 I need to use sanitary pad to soak in my ass sweat.#### #### ####[]
27 is enough unless you have thick comforters.#### #### ####[]
"26c for room, 28c for living room"#### #### ####[]
I don't think people trying to save money on AC are drinking 10 Starbucks a month though. OP may be the exception rather than the norm.#### #### ####[]
"I also say so sia. Come to think of it air-con is a sinkie pwn sinkie thing as well.\n\nGot aircon - remove heat from your room but transfer heat to outside and heats up Singapore\n\nNo aircon - get fked by the grp above (not that I blame yall) due to externalities\n\nIts like a benign ""fk u got mine"" phenomenon"#### #### ####[]
I think about this too.#### #### ####[]
Or…you could go without AC *and* the 10 Starbucks a month and save even more money! *taps head*#### #### ####[]
Is this the zoomer version of less avacado#### #### ####[]
"Maybe you very high SES, but most hdb dwellers will have friends in their social circles who don't use ac"#### #### ####[]
"Much respect but tbh with almost the whole country using aircon, isn't this just masochism"#### #### ####[]
"Using an air conditioner is not as bad for the environment as you might think. Air conditioners today are very energy efficient, they use around 0.8kWh per hour. NCCS puts Singapore’s grid factor, or emissions generated per kWh of energy, at around [0.41 kg of CO2](https://www.nccs.gov.sg/singapores-climate-action/power-generation/) per kWh of energy generated. So if you use an air con for one night, you generate around 3.2kg of CO2. To put that in context, that’s equivalent to eating 300g of beef [per OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-per-kg-poore) or a commute on a car."#### #### ####[]
For me i just run mine very high 27-28C. Hopefully the energy used/ heat given out is not so high.#### #### ####[]
"Portable air con bro, $500-600 is enough to buy a decent one."#### #### ####[]
check and seal the the outlet pipe for the condensate with duct tape or something. then can use a vacuum cleaner to suck the exit end if it's choked#### #### ####[]
Quite ex is....?#### #### ####[]
"Hmm, I live as a single tenant w/o AC. My electrical bills is around $40-50? Most common electricity draining items in my home are wifi router, fridge, washing machine and charging ports."#### #### ####[]
less than 100 for 3 ppl. never hit 100 in my whole 35 years existing\n\nThis is my util bill so i believe both water and electricity#### #### ####[]
"Average temperature used to be lower, it will just get worse with climate change.\n\nhttp://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-past-climate-trends/"#### #### ####[]
If your HDB is really old it's unlikely to have any AC unless installed separately.#### #### ####[]
"Thermal variation in Singapore is actually very big, you might be in a cooler area. The difference in the strength of the urban heat island can be a whole 3 degrees, constrasting more ulu neighbourhoods in the north with those closer to central. That can be the difference between a sweltering 31C night where sleeping is neigh impossible and a 28C night which is mildly uncomfortable with a fan.\n\nSee Fig. 2: https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/7/82"#### #### ####[]
"when your heart is calm, you will feel.... cool?"#### #### ####[]
"OP dun exaggerate, according to my parents, they only climbed the grand canyon twice each way, then cross the yellow river and braved the insects of Australia to go to school. \n\nAnd then for extra thrills, they do it again, but parkour style when they go paktor."#### #### ####[]
"Actually, my mom went to school in Johor, and she has to wake up very early to catch the bus too.."#### #### ####[]
"27°C is equivalent to 80°F, which is 300K.\n---\n^(I'm a bot that converts temperature between two units humans can understand, then convert it to Kelvin for bots and physicists to understand)"#### #### ####[]
We keep giving boomers shit but they had the secret to solving global warming all this while...aching bones.#### #### ####[]
"nah my parents are in their 60s and they say they can't sleep without the aircon..even if it was during the rainny nights during the monsoon seasons, they'd still turn on the A/c"#### #### ####[]
you need to go back to primary 3 science class.#### #### ####[]
"Tekong is different, the seabreeze there at night is cooling and because you're usually so tired everyday, you'd sleep like a baby every night."#### #### ####[]
Water heaters they have.#### #### ####[]
Err i’m married with three kids? I visit often#### #### ####[]
"some of us actually have broken down ~~aircons at home that we don't use, many can't be bothered to upgrade as well~~"#### #### ####[]
"I just recently overhauled my 20 year old aircon system, spent around $2k? I think it's quite worth it considering you're living in Singapore."#### #### ####[]
Because mine had leakage in the pipe and that meant tearing down part of the house. So we just left it like that because no money to renovate lol..#### #### ####[]
Lol#### #### ####[]
r/onlyfans#### #### ####[]
LOL WHAT 🤣🤣🤣#### #### ####[]
"my parents installed some false wall that requires hacking, though i can afford to pay for the renovations, think i’ll just wait until my own place? 5 years later idk who knows"#### #### ####[]
Lmao thanks for the heads up. \n\nWill definitely keep that in mind when I source for it in future.#### #### ####[]
Really? Where ahh?#### #### ####[]
I understand the need for hand washing certain clothes but all clothes?#### #### ####[]
Older people are already set in their ways. It's very hard to break lifelong habits.#### #### ####[]
"As much as I really like the sensibilities of LKY, it doesn't take a genius to appreciate the usefulness of air-conditioning. Take it easy with the quotes eh..."#### #### ####[]
"We have AC at home too.. we turn it on for an hour on super hot days. but, the crippling expensive electricity bills doesn't allow us to enjoy turning ac on for the whole night."#### #### ####[]
Options baby. I didn't say default. Lol.#### #### ####[]
What thread?#### #### ####[]
They need to service their AC lol. I really can't believe it#### #### ####[]
Better a cold floor than a warm mattress. You can get used to sleeping on the floor in a week.#### #### ####[]
"I rather be able to sleep, be it on the floor or mattress."#### #### ####[]
Actually sleeping on the floor is pretty cooling leh#### #### ####[]
That's the beauty of having redundant AC system.#### #### ####[]
"I have never thought of it that way but yes, you are right. When I was young, AC are only for rich people and I suggested my parents to move to cooler place."#### #### ####[]
The thing about boomers is you just gotta take the plunge and do things yourself.\n\nDon’t wait or be passive.\n\nThey’ll thank you later for installing the a/c.\n\nYou can ask them for a refund after that too.#### #### ####[]
"Single room air cons consume 500W to 1500W. At sg’s rate of 0.25c/kiloWHr, it would cost $1 to $3 to turn it on for 8 hours. Your family can think of other ways to cut cost to achieve the air con life. \n\n(such as having the whole family switch to sim only plans that cost $20/pax, instead of scammy contract plans)"#### #### ####[]
Why can't we just turn all of that humidity to drinking water and solve our water shortage at the same time?#### #### ####[]
If only the humidity then maybe try a dehumidifier?#### #### ####[]
yeah I just set it to 26 degrees just to cool the room down and remove the humidity during the afternoons and it helps a ton.#### #### ####[]
"I know heaps of ac less people , but they smoke cigarettes like we drink water.\n\nWhy the fuck would you buy ciggies in this day and age? That shit is expensive.."#### #### ####[]
"Ya la. Replace it with whatever you spend on that's not required. Like bubble tea , snacking on ruffles, To me aircon is a need not a want."#### #### ####[]
"The whole goodamn world has been playing this game forever, as if the rich are not breathing the same air, drinking from the same resource.... therefore, fuck the ultra rich and their retarded elitist mindset."#### #### ####[]
Definitely not high ses. Just saw statistics in an earlier comment. 20% no aircon#### #### ####[]
The correct term is being socially and environmentally responsible.#### #### ####[]
"It’s not just about electrical consumption though. Heat pumps (aircon, fridge, anything that separates cool air from hot air) almost always generate excess heat that is released into the environment. Meaning, it is not just pumping out the heat that is removed from your cool air, but also additional heat due to the work done in separating cold air from hot. All this contributes to further heating of the planet."#### #### ####[]
Above 150$ less than 200 range#### #### ####[]
So true#### #### ####[]
"i remember when i was in primary and secondary school, i'll wear a jacket to go to school in the morning."#### #### ####[]

"I mean OK but now 2022, can put that phase behind liao bah 😅 uncle auntie buy aircon... Use at 25c won't kill bills de. Make your life easier"#### #### ####[]
No need for Fahrenheit here.#### #### ####[]
Bad bot#### #### ####[]
It's a known fact that people lose the ability to tolerate the cold as we age.#### #### ####[]

Haha yea no need convince me. Is my parents that need convincing rly.#### #### ####[]
"Aircon increases sleep quality and therefore your productivity. Think of it as an investment in yourself, not a comfort luxury."#### #### ####[]

"Probably Google the range of models that you want, go carousell search, negotiate lor."#### #### ####[]

it's cooling but.. isn't it too hard...?#### #### ####[]
Meaning you have 2 ac in one bedroom?#### #### ####[]
"Very good point. Probably need to just do, they shout for a day I just leave the place for that day"#### #### ####[]
"Our problem with water is that we have too much rainfall (one of the highest in the world), no place to store tbh. \n\nAtmospheric water generator won't help us in that regard"#### #### ####[]
They are called atmospheric water generator but essentially they are dehumidifier with a water tank.#### #### ####[]
Would require a tonne of energy because removing water from air is pretty tough#### #### ####[]

"Must have very few friends then, with such a high rate of no-aircon."#### #### ####[]
"I agree, just saying it's a crazy uphill battle to convince the whole sg to not use aircon / only use as dehumifier / use at 25c\n\nWe have the same issue as HK, cold = prestige and status."#### #### ####[]
"Not only that, local studies have proven that too much use of AC indoors leads to acclimatisation and more discomfort outdoors. This leads you to desire even more AC use, it's a vicious cycle. Not saying that AC use is bad if done in a controlled manner, jus try not to use it too often.\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/257172082_Thermal_comfort_in_outdoor_urban_spaces_in_Singapore"#### #### ####[]
"Ah you're right, but only HDBs post 1994 have higher rated amps of 40 which is why older units are very rarely with AC."#### #### ####[]
"Right, I'm just giving example roughly-representative numbers, not taking the yearly highs. Look at the map; unless you're at a central or southeast region, imagine tacking a few more degrees onto your temperatures. The woodlands and CCK areas are especially cool; I live near there and it's fine to sleep without AC, but a few degrees make a big difference near the threshold of comfort.\n\nIf annual highs can be ~31 at night in a cool region, imagine what it would be like in an area with extra degrees on average."#### #### ####[]

yeah this is completely useless info. ive been saying to my friends who die die need aircon. they grew up with ac and acclimatised already so the cycle is just going to continue from their generation on. \n\nthe ac business world makes people think ac is about the electricity to people feel better with the three ticks on their aircon not realising they contribute to the reason their region is hot asf and ‘unbearable’#### #### ####[]
You don’t need 40 amp switch for some AC btw - some singular wall units can use normal 3 pin.#### #### ####[]

"Basically it's the Apple of these type of products kinda overpriced but does it well. The drying function is more like a really good supplement as it won't dry it fully in wet weather or night time.

Easy to control on the up and down.\n\nOverall I would say it makes hanging clothes much more bearable at a cost. Mostly I buy it because I don't want my mom reaching up and hurting herself anymore.

"> # Groomsman guilty of sexually assaulting bride on wedding night\n\n> SINGAPORE: After a night of drinking, a groomsman sexually assaulted the bride of his close friend in the bridal suite on the couple's wedding night.\n\n> The offender was convicted on Monday (May 30) after contesting two charges of sexual assault and using criminal force to outrage the woman's modesty at trial.\n\n> The identities of the offender and victim are protected by gag order. Details of the wedding, which took place in 2016, are not published as they could lead to identification of the parties involved.\n\n> The court heard that the victim and her husband have since divorced.\n\n> The offender, now in his 40s, was part of a group of groomsmen and bridesmaids who were invited to an after-party in the couple's bridal suite when the banquet ended.\n\n> Alcohol was available during the meal, and the group ordered and consumed more alcohol while in the suite.\n\n> Around 1am, the victim felt tired and left to shower and was alone in the bedroom while the group stayed in the living room.\n\n> The after-party ended at about 3am with everyone leaving except for the accused and victim's husband, who had fallen asleep in the living room.\n\n> Principal District Judge Victor Yeo said the main issues at trial were the facts of what had happened, and said that he believed the victim's testimony over the offender's.\n\n> VICTIM'S TESTIMONY\n\n> At trial, Deputy Public Prosecutors Ng Yiwen and Goh Yong Ngee argued that at about 6am, the victim woke up and felt she was being touched at her chest and private part.\n\n> She thought it was her husband and spoke to him, asking him to shower and sleep on the left side of the bed that she had left empty for him.\n\n> After each time she spoke, there was no response and the touching would momentarily stop before resuming.\n\n> The woman thought that the person might not be her husband as she felt the texture of jeans, which was not what he wore at the banquet.\n\n> However, she did not say anything as she did not think anyone besides her husband was in the bedroom with her.\n\n> After some time, she began to think that something was amiss and tried to look but the room was very dark and she could not see the person's face clearly.\n\n> The offender did not reply when she asked him to identify himself, and the victim became scared. Leaving the bedroom, she saw her husband in the living room and woke him up.\n\n> At that moment, the offender came out of the bedroom and started talking to the victim's husband. The victim saw that he was shirtless and wearing jeans.\n\n> She later confronted the offender and accused him of touching her.\n\n> The offender initially denied this, then later admitted to the victim's husband that he had touched her chest but not her private part.\n\n> The victim's husband told the offender to leave and the victim decided to make a police report.\n\n> OFFENDER'S TESTIMONY\n\n> Defence lawyers Edmond Pereira and Jessica Cheung argued that the offender believed he had woken up in his own bed at home.\n\n> He admitted to touching the victim's chest, saying that he had mistaken her for his wife. However, he denied sexually assaulting her.\n\n> The man claimed to have immediately retracted his hand when he heard the victim, which did not sound like his wife.\n\n> When he got out of bed and turned around, he said he was shocked to see that the person next to him was the victim.\n\n> He claimed that he went to the living room, where he woke the groom up and said he was sorry he had touched the victim's chest as he thought he was at home.\n\n> The man said he then left for home after he had put on his clothes and the groom told him he would settle the matter.\n\n> ""DESPERATE EXCUSE""\n\n> Judge Yeo said the offender's account of events was a ""desperate excuse"" conceived retroactively to explain his actions, and that his defence of mistaking the victim for his wife was ""unbelievable"".\n\n> If the offender believed he was at home, then he failed to explain why he deviated from his usual practice of sleeping on the floor instead of the bed if he had not showered, said the judge.\n\n> The offender's claim that the sounds he heard from the victim was also ""clearly a fabrication"" that differed from her evidence, said Judge Yeo.\n\n> Additionally, the man's behaviour with the groom in the living room after the incident was more consistent with guilt, and the offender was ""clearly trying to portray that he had owned up to his error immediately"".\n\n> In contrast, the victim was a credible and honest witness, whose account of events was ""unwavering"". It was also consistent and corroborated by evidence from her then husband, said Judge Yeo.\n\n> This made her evidence ""unusually convincing"", and meant the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt, said the judge.\n\n> The offender, who has a prior conviction for distributing uncensored films, will return to court for sentencing in July.\n\n> The punishment for sexually penetrating another person without consent is punishable with up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning.\n\n> The penalty for using criminal force to outrage a person's modesty is up to two years' jail, a fine, caning or any combination of these punishments.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

Interesting fantasy. Jerk fuel?#### #### ####[]
Wow so sad it broke the marriage.#### #### ####[]
">The offender, who has a prior conviction for distributing uncensored films, will return to court for sentencing in July.\n\nugh ew"#### #### ####[]
How about no wedding party?#### #### ####[]
Or why did this case take so long to conclude. Marriage over but the court case still dragging... not even a complicated legal battle.#### #### ####[]
Another news outlet reported that the couple dated for 11 years and divorced immediately after the incident. My guess is the groomsman managed to penetrate the bride. The husband probably found himself unable to continue the marriage after that.\n\nIt's a very tragic incident.#### #### ####[]
"My guess is more likely the wife resented the husband having this kind of ""friend"" who destroyed what is supposed to be the best day of their lives. Seeing as how the wife can make husband sleep on floor, likely she calls the shots"#### #### ####[]
Also very similar to influencer Rachel wong case. Why wedding night need to do so many funny funny thing ah. If all party cannot take things as joke or cannot control urge them why need to drink until siao.#### #### ####[]
or maybe someone will be sleeping and touching him at night in his cell...#### #### ####[]
lol. must have been 20 years ago w/o internet days?#### #### ####[]
"No wedding party or not, does it matter when u have a sexual assaulter as a friend?"#### #### ####[]
not immediately. a report from march 2020 said they started divorce proceedings that year - 4 years after the incident#### #### ####[]
The wife who makes her husband sleep on the floor is the offender’s wife though.\n\nThe one getting divorced is the assault victim’s and her husband who is the offender’s friend.#### #### ####[]
"It's the accused's wife that makes the accused sleep on the floor, not the victim."#### #### ####[]
Definitely not the same thing.. Rachel consented to that. this was unwanted nor had consent#### #### ####[]
"Well, there’s a separation period of 3 yrs before divorce proceedings can start. Hence the timeline checks out"#### #### ####[]
"Ah, I must have misread somewhere, the use of Groom and Groomsman makes it kinda confusing to follow"#### #### ####[]
I think he only sleeps on the floor if he haven't showered.#### #### ####[]
"No leh. Can annul or fast forward the divorce, had a friend who divorced in a matter of months"#### #### ####[]
Can’t for this case. Annulment must be done within 3 years of marriage.#### #### ####[]
I mean they could have annulled it earlier so dunno why they didn’t do so#### #### ####[]

"As a female teacher in the past, I always felt that male teacher attire should be reviewed. Now even more so with covid and the mask regulations. I think teaching in office attire with mask on in a non aircon classroom must be terrible! \n\nMore schools are moving towards relaxed attires for students (I see more students with burmudas or polo shirt attire these days) which I think is the right way forward. I don’t think we should be have our children grow up only in air conditioned environments so having appropriate clothing is particularly important with climate change. With that, I strongly feel male teachers attire should be reviewed. Maybe office attire should only be required for formal events like PTM etc. \n\nI would also love to see all classrooms equipped with air conditioning so that on days with extreme heat at least it would be available. I’m sure there are ways to regulate the use of air conditioning so that it isn’t misused. For example, it can be programmed to only be available in the afternoons. This would also come in handy if the haze returns. But perhaps it would cost too much to install and maintain?"#### #### ####[]

"Many neighbouring countries are developing countries, which usually have higher fertility rates.\n\nSome of the biggest contributors to lower fertility rates are access to contraceptives, access to education (particularly by women), lower infant mortality rate, and higher standards of living.

"> # 'If you do it your way, I slap you': Woman gets jail for repeatedly assaulting maid\n\n> SINGAPORE: A woman who was unhappy with the way her domestic worker did housework repeatedly assaulted the maid by slapping and hitting her.\n\n> Zhao Lin, 35, was on Monday (May 30) sentenced to five months' jail and a fine of S$1,000.\n\n> She pleaded guilty last month to four charges of voluntarily causing hurt and one count of mischief for damaging a phone that the victim bought to contact her family.\n\n> Another four charges were considered for sentencing.\n\n> The court previously heard that the victim, a Myanmar national, started working for Zhao in February 2016. Zhao was her first employer.\n\n> The victim's job scope included taking care of Zhao's son, who was aged about four at the time.\n\n> Zhao started abusing the victim in 2017 by hitting her because her work or attitude was purportedly not satisfactory.\n\n> She also deducted S$100 to S$200 from her maid's S$500 salary each month for mistakes made at work, such as breaking crockery.\n\n> The victim accepted the salary deductions as she ""did not know what would happen to her if she refused"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Teo Lu Jia.\n\n> WHAT HAPPENED\n\n> Zhao was working as a nurse at the time of the offences on Aug 25, 2018, which were captured by closed-circuit television cameras around the home.\n\n> The abuse started around midnight that day, when Zhao accused the victim of not keeping her son's toys properly.\n\n> Zhao told the victim, then 25, to ""stand properly"" and slapped her forcefully 10 times, loudly counting several of the slaps.\n\n> The victim did not retaliate. After slapping her, Zhao went on to sort her son's toys while saying: ""I will do it until you are really, really scared.""\n\n> The victim subsequently teared and cried quietly when she was alone.\n\n> In the morning, Zhao slapped the victim 10 times again as punishment for forgetting to wash some laundry.\n\n> A more sustained assault took place later that day, at about 4.30pm. The victim was cleaning the living room when Zhao suddenly asked her to stop and slapped her.\n\n> Zhao scolded the victim for the way she was vacuuming the floor and told her to ""use your eyes to see"".\n\n> Shortly after, Zhao slapped the victim again forcefully. The victim was shocked and spoke to the accused.\n\n> Zhao then shouted at the victim: ""Do it my way! What you're doing is your way! Everything I teach you, everything cannot remember!""\n\n> Zhao continued shouting at the victim, who replied again. Zhao got angry and hit the victim's arm and pulled her hair while shouting.\n\n> She swung her hand and hit the victim's cheek and arm, and kicked her twice at her upper thigh.\n\n> When the victim used her hands to block the blows, Zhao shouted, among other things: ""How dare you?!""\n\n> Zhao's son was in the living room during this assault and asked his mother why she was hitting the maid, to which she replied that the victim ""did wrong"" and ""hit mum"".\n\n> When Zhao stopped hitting her, the victim continued with housework while Zhao shouted various things, including: ""If you do it your way, I slap you. I will make sure you remember that, and my slap is always harder.""\n\n> About half an hour later, still unhappy with how the victim had done housework earlier, Zhao walked up to the victim and slapped her forcefully again.\n\n> The victim did not retaliate. For the next 15 minutes, Zhao continued scolding her about various issues.\n\n> She pulled the victim's hands, kicked the victim at her upper thigh and hit her arm repeatedly while scolding the woman for ""arguing"" with her.\n\n> At about 5.15pm, the victim called the police. She had not reported the assaults earlier as she was afraid of losing her job and feared Zhao, the court heard.\n\n> While the victim was making the police report, Zhao stared at her. When the call ended, Zhao immediately slapped the victim forcefully, hit her head, pulled her hair and kicked her while shouting.\n\n> When police arrived, they asked to view the CCTV footage but Zhao refused to show it to them.\n\n> Zhao's husband returned home later and informed the police officers that there were memory cards in the CCTV cameras. These were seized for investigations.\n\n> The victim was taken to the hospital, where she was found to have a contusion on her forehead and abrasions on various parts of her body.\n\n> Zhao also suffered bruises from the victim's efforts to defend herself against the assaults.\n\n> ""HUMILIATING"" ABUSE, SAYS PROSECUTION\n\n> The prosecution sought at least five to seven months' jail and a fine of about S$1,000, highlighting the victim's vulnerability as a migrant without a support network and in a subordinate position to her employer.\n\n> Ms Teo argued that the sustained abuse caused increasing psychological harm with each escalating incident, adding that the victim would cry and feel traumatised when she recounted what happened.\n\n> The nature of the abuse was also ""humiliating"", as it was calculated to bully the victim into submission, said the prosecutor.\n\n> Defence lawyer John Koh raised Zhao's post-natal depression in mitigation, although Ms Teo argued that this was found not to have a significant contributory link to Zhao's offences.\n\n> Zhao earlier made voluntary compensation of S$6,300 to the victim for the pain and suffering she experienced, her prospective earnings during unemployment and the damage to her phone.\n\n> The punishment for voluntarily causing hurt is jail for up to two years, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. Zhao was liable for an enhanced penalty of one-and-a-half times the maximum punishment as she committed the offences against a domestic worker.\n\n> The offence of mischief is punishable with jail for up to one year, a fine or both.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

"Wait till u see this..\n\n\nIn November 1990, Choo issued a false invoice from his company claiming to have sold equipment worth more than a million dollars to Wong See Kee, Choo's brother-in-law. Wong had used the invoice to get S$830,000 in financing, supposedly to pay for the purchase of the equipment. In 1999, Choo was charged with cheating. He resigned from his MP position and PAP before pleading guilty in court to a charge which was reduced from aggravated to simple cheating.\n\n\nChoo's former fellow MP and Senior Counsel, K Shanmugam, represented Choo. Shanmugam pushed for a fine instead of a jail sentence. Petition letters by grassroots leaders, vouching for Mr Choo's character, described Choo as ""hardworking,"" ""compassionate,"" ""selfless"" and dedicated to community service. Lee Hsien Loong, the then Acting Prime Minister, said that Choo has done the right thing in resigning as an MP and PAP member, before pleading guilty in court.\n\n\nChoo was sentenced to two weeks' jail and fined S$10,000.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) received several anonymous complaints against Choo alleging that he had charged his personal airfares, expenses, phone bills to STTA and received gifts from Chinese coaches and players. The total amount involved about S$10,600. The offences were allegedly committed during Choo's tenure as the president of the STTA.\n\nThe CPIB conducted investigations revealed that in 2005, Choo had received S$1,500 from Liu Zhongze, who was then a national team player, and Luo Jie, who was then an assistant coach of the STTA, in return for giving Liu more opportunities to represent the STTA in table tennis tournaments. Between 2003 and 2004, Choo is believed to have accepted USD$600 on two separate occasions from Shi Mei Sheng, who was then a STTA coach for approval of usage of two different training facilities in China.\n\n\nOn 8 December 2011, Choo was charged with three counts of corruption and one of criminal breach of trust. Koh Li Ping, former High Performance Manager of STTA, was also involved in the criminal breach of trust charge.\n\n\nThe CPIB said that between 2002 and 2003, Luo Jie, whose work pass only permitted him to work for STTA, provided table tennis training to students of Fuhua Secondary School. But the school was unable to pay him for the training provided, which amounted to S$8,400. Luo Jie told Choo and Koh about this, both of them then allegedly arranged with the school principal to engage STTA in a new training arrangement. The proceeds for the new training arrangement received will be used to pay Luo Jie for the outstanding fees. After STTA received the payment from the school, Koh obtained approval from Choo to authorise a payment of S$8,400 to Luo Jie, even though the latter did not provide any training services under the new training arrangement.\n\n\nChoo was acquitted of his charge of criminal breach of trust after the prosecution dropped the three other counts of corruption and proceeded with the criminal breach of trust charge\n\n\n\nhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/topic/cheating\n\n\nI see other cheating cases get sentenced way more than 2 weeks.\n\n\n> According to court documents, Tay was sentenced to 30 months' jail on Monday."#### #### ####[]

Sad thing is that some of the hawkers or shop keepers, their maids/helpers really didn't mind doing it because they actually get mingle with people and they actually get to earn abit more\n\nI sometimes visit these older hawkers from when i was young and sometimes i'd ask if they can hire help and they said they're still blacklisted"#### #### ####[]

Well honestly did he rape anybody? All he did was offer money to them in exchange for sex.

"Lawyers actually don't do that. They are not counsellors or investigators. Lawyers also prefer to go to trial for the fees involved. As they represent the client and paid for by the client, they will follow the instructions of the client. They will however provide an estimate of cost if it goes to trial and most will ask for money upfront. \n\nSome clients will ask what their chances are and the lawyers will provide what evidence is against the client but not say what the chances are as they are so many unknowns. In this case, the victim had a video recording of their conversation which victim's friend's help record. And victim did say that he revealed his age which DK acknowledged. Very damning.\n\nMost people go to trial for serious cases despite overwhelming evidence so they can say to family and friends they are innocent. Save face. (The court was wrong, lawyer not good, police fixed them up, framed by victim) \n\nDK at his previous court appearance stated his intention to plead guilty but did not agree with DPP's Statement of Facts. So they sought an adjournment to agree on the SOF. The next day, DK attempted to carve out his own (misleading and sly) narrative and put out a video. That video was then removed. I suspect AG Chambers had a word with his lawyers and the deal on the number of charges preferred and to proceed might have to change as he was playing games. \n\nSo it was no surprise that the SOF was unusually lengthy and transparent for someone pleading guilty. Basically they could not trust him not to issue another misleading narrative. \n\nWorse still is the order for MOH examination to determine his paedophilic leanings if any. Which I don't think he expected. \n\nIn my view he was trying to save money and thought he could get away by providing ""alternative facts"" by pleading guilty. \n\nIn a nutshell he tried to game the system but it backfired."#### #### ####[]
Innocent of penetrating 3inch in? Coz he only have 2?#### #### ####[]
"Its a myth with some exception. People make those claims to appease their family members, friends and work colleagues. And then make all sorts of claims such as saving money, avoid publicity, protect friends, framed so badly by the victim and police and no hope but plead guilty. . \n\nWhy would anyone even with borderline IQ admit to something that he or she had not done and face the harsh consequences. \n\nThe Police and the DP cannot charge let alone accept a plea if they can't provide basic evidence of wrong doing against the accused. They in turn will face criminal charges if they proceed to charge an innocent man with no evidence. \n\nSo it would take 3 separate parties to result in an innocent person pleading guilty. The innocent person, the Police and the AG chambers. Remember all guilty pleas must accompanied by a statement of facts prepared by the prosecution which means it is also fabricated. What are the mathematical odds for all 3 bending and the breaking the laws of natural justice."#### #### ####[]

"As there is trial and no evidence presented, judges do not have the opportunity to determine innocence or guilt. A plea is rejected when an accused pleads guilty and then qualifies his guilty plea but stating that he actually did not do it or that the statement of facts are wrong or he was a forced to plead guilty. \n\nIt is not an uncommon occurrence. The judge rejects the plea but 9 out of 10 times, the accused will PG without qualification at the next court appearence."#### #### ####[]

"We don't have American-style plea deals in Singapore courts. We have the representations process. It's a negotiation between the accused and prosecution. One common approach is to set out mitigating factors and then say your client is prepared to take a certain course of action (i.e. plead guilty) if the charge is reduced/PP does not ask for custodian sentence. But none of these binds the court. The judge's sentencing powers are not fettered by what the prosecution asks for, though in practice the judge do take them into consideration.\n\nThe other issue is the accused must admit to a Statement of Facts. Any attempt to quality this admission or any sign that the accused believes the Statement of Facts is inaccurate will lead to rejection of the guilty plea. So if you go to PG and start saying shit like, I'm innocent, I didn't do this, or I did this but not that, but I have no choice but to plead guilty because blah blah, your guilty plea will not be accepted. \n\nDo people plead guilty even though they are innocent? I don't know. I think a better way to put that across is, do people plead guilty even though they *believe* they are innocent. To that question, I think the answer is yes. People are free to believe whatever they want."#### #### ####[]

"> # Total wage growth rebounded to 3.9% in 2021, but real growth in salaries dampened by higher inflation\n\n> SINGAPORE: Total wage growth rebounded to 3.9 per cent in 2021, comparable to before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, but real wage growth was dampened by higher inflation last year, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) said on Monday (May 30).\n\n> Real wage growth came in at 1.6 per cent in 2021 amid higher inflation last year. That figure is only slightly above the 1.4 per cent registered in 2020, and lower than the 3.3 per cent in 2019.\n\n> ""The strong recovery of Singapore’s economy and a tight labour market prompted more employers to raise their employees’ wages in 2021, following a period of wage moderation in 2020,"" said MOM.\n\n> ""As a result, more employees received wage increases last year, and wages also grew at a faster pace than in 2020.""\n\n> Total wage growth, including employer Central Provident Fund contributions, among resident employees who have been with the same employer for at least one year was 3.9 per cent in 2021 - the same as 2019. This is up from the 1.2 per cent recorded in 2020.\n\n> ""The rebound in total wage growth in 2021 reflects the broad-based economic recovery across industries, and a tight labour market due to border restrictions slowing down the inflow of non-resident labour,"" the ministry said.\n\n> After the global financial crisis, total wage growth rebounded the following year in 2010 to 5.7 per cent in the period of recovery.\n\n> While 2021's total wage growth also rebounded, it was lower than 2010, suggesting that employers may have been ""more cautious given the longer tail"" of the COVID-19 pandemic, said MOM.\n\n> ""As COVID-19 had a less severe impact on wages compared to the global financial crisis, wage growth also had less ground to recover in 2021 compared to 2010,"" added the ministry.\n\n> THREE IN FOUR EMPLOYERS PROFITABLE IN 2021\n\n> With Singapore's economy expanding by 7.6 per cent in 2021, the proportion of profitable employers increased from 63 per cent in 2020 to 75 per cent last year, enabling some employers to restore wage cuts made in 2020.\n\n> About 70 per cent of employees had wage increases in 2021, compared to 59 per cent in 2020, said MOM.\n\n> The extent of their wage increases was also higher in 2021 (6.3 per cent) than in 2020 (4.5 per cent). The proportion of employees that saw wage cuts in 2021 (10 per cent) was about half of 2020 (23 per cent).\n\n> Among employees who saw wage cuts in 2021, the wage cuts were less steep than in 2020.\n\n> SECTORS REGISTERED HIGHER TOTAL WAGE GROWTH\n\n> All sectors experienced higher total wage growth in 2021 compared to 2020, said MOM.\n\n> Outward-oriented sectors, in particular information and communications, financial and insurance services and manufacturing, registered healthy expansion even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to see ""strong wage growth"" in 2021, said MOM.\n\n> The information and communications sector saw total wage growth of 5.1 per cent, followed by the financial and insurance services at 4.1 per cent and manufacturing at 4 per cent.\n\n> Among domestic-oriented sectors, retail trade registered the highest wage increase at 5.5 per cent.\n\n> Sectors that were more affected by the pandemic also registered wage increases as demand for manpower rose in tandem with the reopening of borders, said MOM.\n\n> ""2021 saw a rebound in total wage growth, in tandem with the broad-based economic recovery,"" said MOM.\n\n> ""Real wage growth was dampened by rising inflation but remained positive and grew slightly faster compared to 2020.\n\n> ""In 2022, we expect the tight labour market to support continued nominal wage growth, although the significant relaxation of border restrictions will allow the non-resident workforce numbers to recover and ease some of the tightness.""\n\n> Downside risks to the global economy remain, such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and protracted global supply disruptions. MOM said this could moderate demand and nominal wage growth.\n\n> With recent shocks to the global supply chains, inflation is projected to stay elevated and dampen real wage growth this year, the ministry added.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

"I don't doubt that MND's statement is technically accurate. I just think they are glossing over and not addressing what people are complaining about.\n\nMy [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/qmdrxe/comment/hjb5qiu/) from when MND first put out its parliamentary reply on this issue.\n\n>I don't think that a clear picture has been painted on whether housing affordability has improved. If you have been following the issue, the complaints on housing prices only became more strindent around the start of 2021.So the grouse is that homes are becoming less affordable recently, especially since end 2020 when we began seeing the return of COVs.\n\n>The increase in resale prices was 5% in 2020 and 8.9% year to date for 2021. Income growth rate has not kept pace for 2020 (was negative, possibly due to covid). 2021 wage data is not out yet but doubt it will hit 8.9% to match resale prices' increase and there's still one more quarter for resale prices to rise further.\n\n>I have no doubt that MND's statement is technically accurate; it is a reply in Parliament after all. But I feel that MND's statement tries to gloss over the unhappiness over the recent spike in prices by using the phrase ""generally kept pace"". Why only ""generally""? Were there year(s) where it did not keep pace? Is it currently when people are complaining? That's for our MPs to ask I guess but we shall also see when the data for 2021is out.

"The gap was always there. Just that now terms like Gen Z or Boomer are more popular and easy to meme about. \n\nIn the end, every generation hates the one that came before it for being too old fashioned, and the one that came after for being too new. \n\nYou can even see it now- there are lots of TikToks from [Gen Zs making jokes about Millenial culture](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/gen-z-mocking-millennials) and vice versa."#### #### ####[]
"> # The Big Read: Generational gap — a bridge too far or are we making too much of it?\n\n> Dr Mathew Mathews, a principal research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), acknowledged that the difference between generations is certainly real but there are many areas where aspirations are similar.\n\n> Pointing to results from the World Values Survey conducted by the IPS and released last year, Dr Mathews said the difference in opinion between generations here is actually “fairly small”.\n\n> “For instance, there are many priorities that all of us, regardless of age group, tend to embrace — we all have similar views about the importance of the family and the need to respect our elders.\n\n> “Both young and old in Singapore also take great pride in our country and its institutions — we recognise the social values that have helped steer the nation,” he said.\n\n> Agreeing, Asst Prof Ang said on climate change, for instance, Singaporeans across generations recognise it as a real problem that needs to be addressed, rather than it being a hoax or a conspiracy.\n\n> And on LGBTQ issues, most across the generations will probably agree that LGBTQ individuals should not be discriminated against.\n\n> “These are important commonalities that we should not downplay, especially in a society where different generations have come of age in vastly different environments,” he added.\n\n> HOW TO BRIDGE THE GAP\n\n> Rather than adopting the divisive practice of stereotyping each generation, individuals can instead focus on the commonalities that they share in order to bridge the gap, said the experts.\n\n> Asst Prof Ang said: “Older cohorts need to fight against the tendency to infantilise younger cohorts, while younger cohorts need to fight against the tendency to demonise older cohorts.”\n\n> To facilitate this, opportunities to allow meaningful cross-generational interactions must be created — whether in school, the workplace or at home, and also beyond these spaces.\n\n> Integrating more adult learners into university classrooms, for instance, can provide a safe space for engagement across generations, he added.\n\n> The NYC poll also highlighted how workplace and community initiatives could be useful in addressing the generational divide and dialogues could help bring different generations together to appreciate each other’s lived experiences.\n\n> So how should individuals seek to bridge the gap?\n\n> Ms Theresa Pong, the counselling director of The Relationship Room, which work with couples and families, said it is important to firstly, remain curious about why people may have differing views and secondly, to be respectful when addressing those views.\n\n> “When you are curious, you will seek the rationale for why people do things because there must be a reason. That’s when the wall can be lowered and true communication can happen.\n\n> “And when you can respect each other’s views, there is this thing called safety in communication. That’s when we know that when we share our views, it won’t be put down or be used against us,” she added.\n\n> Mr John Shepherd Lim, the chief well-being officer of Singapore Counselling Centre, said while it is not practical to expect all perspectives to be fully aligned and individuals to be fully agreeable at all times, there is a need to be mindful of extreme thinking or the “my way or the highway” stance.\n\n> Individuals should also avoid “black or white thinking”, or looking at issues in a straightforward manner, he added.\n\n> “At times we need to layer our perspectives. And we need to understand the context of each party’s viewpoints,"" he said. ""Because once we understand the context and we know where the (other) person is coming from, it is a lot easier to understand, and a lot easier to perhaps negotiate a certain stance.”\n\n> He added that apart from deciding what can be negotiated, it is also helpful for both parties to talk about the issue when they are in better control emotionally.\n\n> Speaking from her own experience, Ms Tan, the actress, said that when it comes to bridging the mother-daughter gap, she sticks to the mantra of ""never sweat the small stuff"".\n\n> “I don’t care what she wears, how she puts her makeup on or how late she stays up at night. I don’t sweat the small stuff. But we talk about the big stuff — our values in life, what’s right and what’s wrong ... we talk about education and work ethics,"" she said.\n\n> For Mr Fairul, the freelance performer, the unending support from the older folks within his family, especially his mother, has given him the confidence to have open conversations about the challenges he faces.\n\n> He said: “She’s very present in my life. She keeps herself up to date with what I’m doing, and she also makes the effort to be friends with my friends. It’s because of her I feel supported and can do the things that I want to do.”\n\n> This article was written in partnership with the National Youth Council and was originally published in TODAY.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

It feels like today is hotter than yesterday :(#### #### ####[]
"If you use AC at night and spend your day in the same room, keep your door closed and don't open your window too much. Your room should feel less hot and humid throughout the day.\n\nIf you're not working or anything, spend the afternoon in a library/shopping mall/cafe.\n\nIf no access to AC at all, fill a spray bottle with cold water and spray yourself whenever the heat gets uncomfortable. If you have money to spare, drink coconut water.\n\nAlso, sometimes it's actually detrimental to let wind into your house. If you feel that the wind is hot, you're better off closing the windows from which the wind is blowing in, retaining the cooler air in your house."#### #### ####[]
"I was joking yesterday at 2pm about it being 34 degrees but feeling like 36 degrees. \n\nBut by 4.30pm it went up to 36 degrees.\n\nJokes on me, I guess."#### #### ####[]

Go office and blast the aircon until company gives in and enforce mandatory work from home.#### #### ####[]
It has somehow become even hotter today wtf#### #### ####[]
Climate change is real#### #### ####[]
"In the day, I use fans and also create a 'wind tunnel' in my house by opening specific windows and the service yard door. Not sure about the science behind it, but doing so somehow create a path of least resistance for air to flow through my house, resulting in strong cooling breeze.\n\nAt night before I sleep, I will turn on my AC with my fan and I will set the AC to auto turn off 1 hr later. I read that the best temp to fall asleep is about 1-2 °c lower than our body temp. So actually don't need ac throughout the night. Just need to cool the temp enough until you fall asleep. The remaining cold air can be circulate by the fan to keep me and the wifey cool. Works well for me, won't waste too much electricity and not as jialat for the environment compared to AC throughout the night.\n\nI also use a mattress protector with cooling gel embedded in it. Highly recommended! It makes the bed feels cooler than the room temp even without AC. With AC, it holds the cooling temp longer. So works well with my auto off AC strat."#### #### ####[]

One thing i find effective is to keep a wet towel and constantly apply all over myself. Helps regulate the heat and i feel less sticky. Another one is to use blackout curtains. Keeping the sunlight out actually cools my house tremendously during the day. Just leave abit of gap for ventilation. \n\n\nOvernight oats in the fridge for lunch is also a good way to maintain your diet and keep cool.#### #### ####[]

"Fans are very useful. A ceiling fan at maximum speed consumes at most 100 Watts while an air conditioner uses 3000 Watts (3 kWh per hour) to cool the room and 500 Watts to maintain the temperature. This is because fans do not cool the air, but rather recirculate cooler air from the rest of the room to replace the film of warm 37 degrees Celcius air around your skin. \n\nIn terms of electricity consumption, fridges use the most electricity as it is run 24/7, consuming 200W or 1 kWh every 5 hours. If you have your TV on and you are not currently watching it, it is better to switch it off as all electronic devices convert their electrical energy to heat energy as their end product. \n\nTo save electricity cooling yourself given the increasing electricity tariffs, use more fans instead. Fans use far less energy than AC. Drink water to cool yourself, water has a high heat capacity. If you want to use the AC, turn on the fan so that the air is circulated and the AC spends minimal time at maximum power.\n\nAnother way to cool yourself more is to switch to a laptop or undervolt your computer. A desktop PC draws about 500 Watts and a laptop about 200 Watts. For those stuck with a desktop, you can switch off your discrete GPU when not gaming, or use Throttlestop to limit CPU clock rates. This can save almost 200 Watts of power and make the surrounding air less warm. \n\nFor those using laptops, use blu-tack/ felt pads/ small eraser and raise the back of the laptop so that the laptop can vent the hot air out towards the rear of the laptop rather than being trapped under the laptop and dispersing the heat. \n\nMobile users should refrain from charging while using the device as charging will be slower and more inefficient also due to increased temperature. Additional power use results in more wasted heat."#### #### ####[]

OT. are you all complaining about the heat but then still wake up to taking a hot shower?! Haha.\n\nI've been bathing without the heater for a few years even on cool rainy days. It's refreshing. Just need to get past the first chilly splash. And not like its an ice bucket challenge.#### #### ####[]

"Portable air conditioners [really suck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-mBeYC2KGc).

Of these, an inverter unit at a sensible setting (eg. 26c or dry) is going to be the most ""cold per kW""."#### #### ####[]
"A couple of things:\n\n* Last night I had the fan on me directly and the AC blasting and I was still hot\n\n* If you get the portable AC then make sure you have a window you can direct the exhaust heat from, otherwise it won't cool anything down"#### #### ####[]

Seconding the comment about closing the door of the room which you turn the AC on in - that room is generally MUCH cooler than the rest of my house.#### #### ####[]
This is the most practical and relatable advice I can find here so far.#### #### ####[]
"Damn, you're a professional! Great tips, thanks."#### #### ####[]
I saw a family sleeping and relaxing in ikea last weekend#### #### ####[]
THANK YOU. I do this but my parents insist that it’s hot that’s why they need to open the windows BUT THAT MAKES IT EVEN HOTTER and they’ll say it’s my fault for closing in the first place. I feel so validated now.#### #### ####[]
Can also cover the windows in aluminium foil to reflect most of the heat during the day. Quite effective but downside is real life perma dark mode...#### #### ####[]
"I do the spray thing while under a ceiling fan when I'm playing on my console in the living room, friends on voice chat thinks I'm using Febreeze lol. But it really does help though, especially when you don't want to keep the AC on 24/7."#### #### ####[]
Yeah people need to learn active techniques to keep the heat out in an environment like Singapore. \n\nDampening heat from UV rays is also imperative. Draw the curtains if you don't need the light in that room and it'll help keep it from heating up over the course of the day.#### #### ####[]
I usually eat watermelon to cool myself down\n\nGuess who had an upset stomach today#### #### ####[]
"I got one of those temperature displays that has an inside and outside sensor to tell if I should open window or not. If cooler outside, open window."#### #### ####[]
Not advisable to keep your windows closed even if you think the wind is hot. You just turn your house into a greenhouse if you do so.#### #### ####[]

Any decent air conditioner can function fine at up to mid 40s c outdoor temperature. \nFor example this random Diakin manual quotes 46c at its max:\nhttps://www.daikinac.com/content/assets/DOC/CTXSWallOperationManual.pdf page 9\n\nI think your AC is just on its last legs if it cannot function at only 36c.#### #### ####[]
"When was the last time you did servicing? Your filter could be clogged with dust, reducing efficiency"#### #### ####[]
"If you have a fan, you could try running it at the same time as your AC if it lets you cope with higher AC temperatures. \n\nBecause moving air is a lot less energy intensive than cooling it, AC at higher temp + fan on full blast can actually be more energy efficient and cooling than AC at lower temp.\n\nhttps://www.coolray.com/help-guides/can-i-use-both-air-conditioner-and-ceiling-fan-together-faq"#### #### ####[]

That's what my parents say when they want me to not use aircon (they live in a condo and yet so stingy). I'm naturally hot (like have warm hands and feet bc i'm fat) so even when i was young i never feel cold in aircon places or ever need to wear a jacket. So this doesnt work for me. Even when i lived in other countries i find myself walking in a tshirt during their winter (10 degrees)#### #### ####[]

"Not necessarily. Although things are getting heated up here, tropical regions like SG still have the advantage of stable temperatures throughout the year. In temperate areas, things are likely to get much worse - hotter summers, colder winters, unpredictable weather, and increase in hurricanes etc. Look at the 2019 Australian wildfires, 2021 Texas deep freeze, PNW/Canada heat wave. Not too sure about Nordic regions but being so close to the arctic circle I doubt it would be immune to climate change either.

"Imo portable aircon is not worth it. It works if you have a window near enough where you can install the exhaust pipe. And there's no practical way to install it if you have sliding windows. Most units with price points below normal AC are suitable for small rooms only or you have to sit next to the vent. And yes even those with claims of low noise can be very noisy.

"Compensation is a function of the Market. Companies do have to deal with this. People wanting to quit jobs for more money is hardly news :)\n\nFlexibility is a function of your role and to some extent culture. Roles, where people don't need to be glued to their seats or need to work in a specific window, should be flexible in those aspects. Not being flexible doesn't buy an employer anything and is IMHO just dumb. That said, flexibility is a double-edged sword and can leave your job vulnerable to being exported unless it has a regulatory tether to Singapore.\n\nTraining is the more interesting one of these. I am of course talking about the kind of training that leads to a certification or even a formal degree from an appropriate accredited body/university ( not - watch this video on youtube ...). Some certifications are expensive. Some require a commitment of time. If a company is willing to sponsor an employee in terms of time and/or cost, that's a win for both sides, provided the employee works there in the long term.\n\nMany MNCs do sponsor their employees for such programs provided they have worked for a certain number of years, have performed well, and are willing to work for at least a fixed number of years after the certification/degree is done.\n\nQuestion is - is an employee willing to commit to the company for at least a minimum period if the company spends time/money on their certification? With a pro-rata clawback clause if they leave before that...\n\nSome good companies will use this as an opportunity to introduce such programs. But don't expect everyone to do it.

"SINGAPORE - The pandemic unleashed not only a virus but also a seismic ceding of control from employers to workers worldwide and in Singapore.\n\nAnd it is not letting up as local workers keep up their expectations of more flexibility, training and pay in their jobs, according to surveys out this year.\n\nConducted by firms ranging from talent recruiters Michael Page and Randstad, and human resource consultants Mercer and KellyOCG, to tech companies Cisco and UiPath, these reports all reflect a consistent finding: A majority of local workers intend to quit in the coming months if their demands are not met.\n\nExcept that their bosses, too, are mulling over leaving: 81 per cent of 67 senior executives say they plan to resign within these two years, citing poor work-life balance as one reason in KellyOCG's findings. That statistic is higher than 69 per cent in Asia and 72 per cent globally.\n\nKellyOCG managing director Peter Hamilton expects the trend to persist given the talent crunch. ""Our survey shows that globally, 37 per cent of employee expectations have changed since the pandemic.\n\n""They have higher expectations around work-life balance, flexible working, benefits, well-being support. This figure is higher in Singapore at 43 per cent.""\n\nCompared with the rest of the world, local employers are less prepared to deal with the new aspirations foisted on them. About 12 per cent of them, compared with 15 per cent globally, fared well in an aggregate score that grades firms on employee experience, agility such as in the use of contingent workers, factors including diversity, and adoption of technology.\n\n\nGet tips to grow your investments and career in weekly newsletter\nEnter your e-mail\n Sign up\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.\n\nOnly 21 per cent of local companies said they are engaging employees on flexible work arrangements versus 33 per cent globally, Mr Hamilton said.\n\nIn Mercer's study, 62 per cent of staff say not being able to work remotely or hybrid permanently is a deal breaker when considering whether to join or stay with an organisation.\n\nAbout 86 per cent of C-suite executives, on the other hand, fret over the impact of permanent hybrid and remote working on office bonding, while 60 per cent believe ""fundamentally, work gets done in an office, not remotely"", the report adds.\n\nAuditor Urvish Sawalani, 25, sees no reason for bosses to call workers back. ""We can wake up and start later, but as long as we get the job done, that's what matters.""\n\nHe added: ""I think the perks that emerged to support employees during Covid-19 will become the new norm."" He also noted that employers were ""trying very hard"" to woo talent, including giving handouts to new employees to buy equipment for working from home.\n\nStaff engagement and choice are recurring advice to employers in the reports.\n\nMr Ravin Jesuthasan, Mercer's global leader of transformation services, said: ""The companies that will win are the ones who make it as easy as possible for people to engage with their company and do their work.\n\n""It's not going to be the companies that say, 'I give you flexibility, but you have to be in the office four days a week and those four days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday'. It is not flexibility if it is not a choice.""\n\nMORE ON THIS TOPIC\nS'pore salary guide: Are you getting paid as well as your peers?\nThe Great Renegotiation: Five views on what's changing about work, and what's not\nChoice, however, is not on employers' side, said Associate Professor Tan Hwee Hoon of the Singapore Management University.\n\nUntil the labour market eases, ""employers are unlikely to dictate where employees work"", she added.\n\n""There is no going back to the five-day work week. Some folks are talking about a 10-month work year, pointing to the need to provide more flexibility rather than less. What is happening in the labour market now is a movement towards employee preferences.""\n\nDespite all that, plus supply chain bottlenecks and inflation, employers are ""cautiously optimistic"" in their outlook, said the Singapore National Employers Federation.\n\nThe employers' trade union is urging bosses to offer versatile work locations, hours and contracts to tap underused labour sources and adopt automation and technology such as robots.\n\n""Technology: If you do it well, you can literally reduce your headcount costs to a fraction of what it is today,"" said its executive director, Mr Sim Gim Guan.\n\nUltimately, workers and employers are on the same team, said Mr Jesuthasan. But unless a global recession sets off a ""reset"", leverage will continue to tilt ""towards the employee side, or maybe stay the same"", he said.\n\nMORE ON THIS TOPIC\nHow Singapore firms are ramping up employee perks in fight for talent\nWork/Life: Bosses have no choice, okay?!\nThe 280,000 local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that hire about 70 per cent of the workforce here are getting the brunt of the talent churn, said recruiters.\n\nMr Kurt Wee, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, said: ""There is a disconnect between what companies need and how the workforce wants to work.\n\n""I will caution everybody not to be overoptimistic because we are facing a globally volatile situation. Employers are facing substantial cost increases on all fronts and there is a bit of job hopping going on.""\n\nCompanies need to recover productivity after the past two difficult years while grappling with a shortage of blue-collar workers, he added.\n\nThe tightening on the import of foreign labour is hurting SMEs, said Mr Wee. ""If you look at the real cost of hiring, and the number of locals you have to hire to hire foreign manpower, it's really expensive.\n\n""A company could feel that the labour supply conditions do not justify doing business any more and decide not to continue.\n\n""Another scenario is businesses deciding to downsize, because if they cannot get labour, why scale?""\n\nMr Sim said: ""Everyone is still readjusting, but by May next year, I believe we should be able to find an equilibrium."""#### #### ####[]

"You may be in an industry where it is not needed, but for some, certification is your key to unlocking a lot of your (transferrable) potential.

For general project managers, you have PMP, Certified ScrumMaster, PRINCE2 etc. For networking professionals, Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), Aruba Certified Mobility Associate (ACMA), Azure/AWS certification just to name a few because networking/security has shit loads of certification. Hell, even WSQ Food Hygiene Course is also needed to work in F&B.\n\nAll these courses costs a lot of $$$ just to attend, and you can't just pick them off Youtube - they need to be from accredited organisations.

Paya Lebar Air Base\n\n> Two of Singapore's air bases - Changi East and Tengah - are being expanded to accommodate the assets of Paya Lebar Air Base, which will move in the 2030s.\n\n> The move will free up about 800ha of land for development, with Mr Lee saying that height restrictions on surrounding areas will also be lifted.\n\n> He said the area possesses heritage and greenery, as well as opportunities for new housing and amenities.\n\n> The Singapore Institute of Architects and the Singapore Institute of Planners are working on plans for the area, which will be displayed for public feedback in June when the Urban Redevelopment Authority exhibits its long-term plans, said Mr Lee.\n\n> In April, he said proposals for the area included creating a heritage district out of old airport buildings.\n\n> 2. Greater Southern Waterfront\n\n> With a coastline of about 30km, the Greater Southern Waterfront, stretching from Pasir Panjang to Marina East, requires a lot of work and planning, said Mr Lee.Freeing up land to develop the waterfront will require the relocation of facilities that are critical to Singapore, he said. These include the city hub and Pasir Panjang ports, which will be moved to Tuas Mega Port.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

"> # Robust pay rises in Singapore last year tempered by inflation\n\n> SINGAPORE - Most workers saw pay hikes last year, but rising prices meant that their gains were tempered.\n\n> With a large majority of companies raking in profits, 70 per cent of workers saw their pay packets expand, with resident workers who had stayed in their jobs for at least one year taking home an extra 3.9 per cent on average.\n\n> But inflation ate into their gains and their spending power increased by just 1.6 per cent - less than half of their nominal pay hikes.\n\n> Despite nominally bigger pay cheques, workers have fared worse only once over the past five years. That was in 2020, when real wage growth was 1.4 per cent despite prices dipping marginally.\n\n> Some 59 per cent of workers saw their nominal pay increase in 2020. The biggest hikes went to junior executives, who have become the most sought-after segment of the workforce.\n\n> Prospects appeared brighter last year as the economy expanded 7.6 per cent and three in four companies were profitable. But an inflation rate of 2.3 per cent diluted real gains for workers.\n\n> High prices are expected to persist for the rest of the year as lockdowns in China and the Ukraine war worsen supply bottlenecks, said Dr Hong Ru, assistant professor of banking and finance at Nanyang Business School.\n\n> “The key is how fast we can get out of this supply chain issue and to really increase productivity. If we can do this fast, we will be in a good position next year,” he said.\n\n> Inflation is expected to peak at 4 per cent between July and September before easing in late 2022.\n\n> Recruiter Michael Page, which reported that most firms were planning to give annual increments of 3 per cent this year, expects that bigger hikes would be made after September.\n\n> Its managing director, Mr Nilay Khandelwal, said: “This is when we would really know what exactly would be the AI (annual increment) and inflation rates. Generally speaking, Singapore AI is pretty much tied to the inflation rate to a large extent.”\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

"> Why should taxpayers help subsidize your flat just because you want to pop out kids?\n\nBecause one of biggest reasons why people don’t want to have kids is because of costs, especially housing costs. Singapore’s birth rate is falling. \n\nSo if there is a way to make it easier for parents to have kids, it should be done, and one way to do that would be through subsidies. \n\nTo be fair it is an imperfect way to subsidize costs given the rise of DINKs."#### #### ####[]
"This is pap's policy platform and a majority of singapore citizens agreed with pap's allocation of 'subsidies' to 'family unit'. So while you may perceive it as 'stupid', this policy has been approved by the citizens.\n\nSo why should tax payer help subsidise the flat for people who wishes to 'pop out kids'? Because the citizens agreed to the 'subsidies'.\n\nPlease note there is no actual subsidies, but 'discount' off 'market price'."#### #### ####[]
"If you look across the world ,’home ownership’ is not a basic survival need. So if you want a roof over your head, it’s a luxury. great life-goal and ambition. Work for it and earn it. A private property will cost around 600k. \n\nIf not you can rent and go to the social services unit if you are too poor. They will house you somewhere."#### #### ####[]

"Don't even need to rip. Their argument collapses unto itself when they brought up renting for the singles, as if married couples dont have the option to rent."#### #### ####[]
"At least PAP IB acknowledges the difficulties of singles getting housing. \n\nThis one... their replies are stupid. ""Home ownership is not a basic survival need"" and yet argues that a house is necessary as a nest for the purpose of creating stability and to provide shelter in order for family to grow (hence worthy of subsidies)\n\nCan't even agree with themselves whether housing is a necessity or not lol."#### #### ####[]
"While the intention is noble, I don't think using childbirth as an end goal is a good way to look at subsidies for house ownership. If we really look at it that way, then the govnt should claw back the subsidies for couples who don't end up having kids within x years, no?\n\nAnd the poster did mention that renting a house is an option for the couple. So based on their own logic, couples can also go rent instead of buy."#### #### ####[]
"lol you're actually using the ""X% voted for this"" argument. (shakes head)"#### #### ####[]
"this argument still carries no weight, why should the majority of people believing in something make it not stupid? do we live in a universe where material truth is dictated by the views of the majority?"#### #### ####[]
"you really just went out and said shelter isn't a basic survival need huh\n\na roof over your head (a.k.a shelter) has been determined as a basic survival need since god knows when, it's one of the 3 first defined basics\n\nand you're here turning all that shit on its head because capitalism has somehow rotted your brain into thinking everything has to give someone else profit"#### #### ####[]
"Japan, Korea and Hong Kong have those scary small 1 person housing which is barely enough to fit a bed and a desk in and that's it. Toilets are common shared. \n\nRent is extremely dirt cheap like $300 a month but you live like that lor, squeezed in with barely room to move. Just a place to sleep in, not for living in.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MtdI5LKfgU\n\nHopefully Singapore will not ever get to that kind of housing..."#### #### ####[]

"That’s why it is a very imperfect way to incentivize couples to have kids, especially with the rise of DINKs. Maybe other measures can be considered, such as priority for couples with kids."#### #### ####[]
"Why is it stupid? Because you deem it so? All society faces the problem of limited resouces and umlimited wants. Just because singapore values 'family unit' more amd allocates resources to it, doesnt mean it is stupid."#### #### ####[]
A roof over head is needed. But is needed in the form of home ownership ? Does the world have enough resource to provide roof as ownership for every single person/family?#### #### ####[]
"You can’t find a shared bedroom for $300 in Singapore. \n\nThat said, Japan has these [1K apartments](https://youtu.be/G7jkFNUoNu8) that is basically a studio apartment. They may be small but might be suitable for young singles who are looking to move out for the first time."#### #### ####[]
I have a friend in Japan who is living just like that. But it may be scary to you it is great for them as a single adult. They get to save more for their retirement in country side.#### #### ####[]

"> # Commentary: Why is there another dengue outbreak in Singapore despite all our efforts?\n\n> SINGAPORE: It never rains, but it pours. Just when COVID-19 cases in Singapore have fallen back to lower levels, we are experiencing yet another outbreak, this time of a more familiar foe – dengue.\n\n> The number of cases reported so far this year has already exceeded the whole of 2021 and is already climbing towards the levels in 2020 when Singapore saw its worst dengue outbreak.\n\n> Why is this happening despite efforts by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the public in mosquito control?\n\n> To borrow terms we’ve become familiar with over the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effective reproductive number – the number of people infected by the mosquitoes infected by one dengue carrier – needs to be kept below 1 to curb transmission. And that isn’t currently happening.\n\n> We know some circumstantial factors that may be responsible for the current outbreak. The recent warm weather is conducive to mosquito population growth. DENV3, the current dominant serotype behind the large majority of cases now, has not circulated at such levels before 2021.\n\n> But here are two broader factors we think are responsible for why outbreaks like the current one still persist: Ever lower population immunity and ever better diagnostics. Ironically, both are good problems to have.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

"Think twice before agreeing into any trial programme from London Weight Management, intentionally or not.\n\nI participated in Scoot survey upon purchasing a ticket.

I must have clicked at a LWM ads.\n\nA lady called me few days later when I was in the midst of something outside, so I couldn't hear them. She called again few days later inviting me to come to a trial session. I said I'm not interested.\n\nThey sent a Whatsapp message about the programme, a lady called me the next few days pestering me to come for trial. I decline again, but she won't let me finish my sentence. I told her I just want to be out of this, I don't want anymore calls, but she kept going.\n\n1.5 week later they sent another Whatsapp that I need to go to a website to withdraw my participation in a trial program so i won't receive anymore calls. The link brings me to enter phone number -> wait for SMS with another link with only 2 tickboxes -> submit button takes forever -> another SMS -> screenshot and send to the Whatsapp.\n\nThey have the cheek to say the trial is absolutely no obligation, when they pester so much just to get someone go to the trial and send a ""threatening"" message that I need to do all the troublesome steps just to withdraw.\n\nTl;dr: THINK TWICE before you click any promo from LWM, unless you are really keen to try their programme and feel it worth the hassle."#### #### ####[]

"When I'm new at the workplace: boss, lay down the law for me.\n\nWhen I'm lao jiao: I am the law.\n\nSeriously though, it depends on how long you've been there and how familiar you are with the work scope/processes.

I don't watch Breaking Bad now certainly. I watched it a long time ago though. It's a masterpiece in television storytelling. And Brian Cranston is such a damn good actor.#### #### ####[]
"Several of my friends who are in that age range does watch the show. \n\nFor BCS, I think the determining factor is whether the person watched BB. If they never watched Breaking Bad previously, it is less likely that they will watch BCS as a standalone series.\n\nAnd like BB, BCS first few seasons is dead slow. You really need the patience and belief to see it through to the subsequent seasons where it gets better."#### #### ####[]
"I watched both. The problem is because Breaking Bad started 14 years ago, it's considered (old) since there's so much more content out there. \n\nFor BCS, it's a really really, really, slow burn. But it's a great show nonetheless. I had my doubts on how a prequel for BB actually worked, but I really like the way it's set up. Happy to discuss anything! (I've watched up to the mid-season finale of the final season of BCS)"#### #### ####[]

"I think it's more that once you reach a certain salary level, you stop thinking about the price of lunch. So they eat at whatever is convenient, and it's very convenient to go to more expensive places because they're not crowded.\n\nI personally solved the crowding issue by going to lunch later, like after 14:00, which also means I don't generally have to go with anyone for lunch, which is good for me.

The most I'd stay is 6 weeks (1.5x), provided I enjoy being there (both job + colleagues) and I'm not in a rush to start a new job somewhere else."#### #### ####[]
"Nothing to feel bad about. You are on probation. It is equally for the employer and for you to assess your fit in the organization.\n\nIf you leaving after only being there for 2 weeks causes other staff to be overworked, they were already overworked to begin with (before you joined).\n\nNo regrets, hand in your letter and decline to extend beyond your last day.\n\nOf course, if you think you would be absolutely bored at home... then no harm just extending and earning $$. Should be less work handed to you since people know you leaving anyway."#### #### ####[]

"I travelled to Melbourne recently and I think 6D5N was just nice for me. Granted, it was my second time there and I was already familiar w some of the popular spots at downtown. But it was during this second trip that I booked some tours and did some sightseeing (2.5 days), and then of course the usual chilling/hanging around central Melbourne for the rest of my time there. FWIW, I took it really slow and easy, but I feel I did a fair amount of both sightseeing and relaxing this trip, so yeah."#### #### ####[]

"> # Forum: Make jobs that require physical labour more attractive to Singaporeans\n\n> I fully support Forum writer Chia Eu Foong's call to make cleaners' jobs more attractive (Make cleaner job more attractive, May 18) by giving better perks and conditions of service.\n\n> Jobs such as cleaning toilets and wiping tables at foodcourts and hawker centres, removing garbage from bin centres in HDB estates, repairing roads and working at construction sites are mostly done by foreign workers. The salaries paid are often low. Singaporeans shun these jobs.\n\n> These jobs are very important and essential to keep Singapore clean and the economy moving forward. For example, if garbage is not cleared from bin centres for even one day, the estates would stink.\n\n> Currently, there are many workers in other countries who are willing to work in Singapore because of the Singapore dollar's strength and the weaker economy in their own countries. But what if this were to one day change? As Singaporeans will not do these jobs, what would happen to the country then?\n\n> The present over-reliance on foreign workers to do these jobs is inadvisable. A good example is how Build-To-Order flats have been delayed due to the foreign labour crunch.\n\n> To entice Singaporeans to do these jobs, the salaries, perks, conditions of service and status have to be improved drastically, whether employers like it or not. Introduce more automation instead of merely relying on physical labour.\n\n> The authorities will have to look into this matter urgently to see how Singapore can be more self-reliant in labour.\n\n> Pavithran Vidyadharan\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

By paying more right? And by not flooding with cheap labor from JB to compete with us right? right?#### #### ####[]
At the end of the day people at the opposite end of the stick will bear the cost. So in this case those on both ends of the stick are Singaporeans. Then it's just a matter of which side you're on.#### #### ####[]
"The whole point is that we need cheap, low cost labour to do these jobs as cheaply as possible, to avoid passing the cost on to Singaporeans. Making the jobs more attractive to Singaporeans will make it more expensive for anyone. \n\nThere will always be cheap labour. Today its Bangladesh, India and Myanmar, tomorrow it might be more impoverished countries in Africa. The key is, are we agile enough to notice trends in the markets our labour comes from, and adapt accordingly? If yes, we have little to fear."#### #### ####[]

"The only way i see it is to increase pay for work requiring more intensive labour. But as a consumer, would u want that to happen? Meaning like 3.5k to 4k for a dish washer? The cost gets passed down. No business will absorb the cost."#### #### ####[]
"It increases the overall operating cost and it drips down to the goods and service offered. The reason these foreign workers are happy with what SG-an consider as pisspoor salary because that amount is still double or triple their salary back home.\n\nI get the idea that he probably want to make SG more self-sufficient, which is indeed needed. But if the services and goods prices increases, later sinkies also complain."#### #### ####[]
"At the end of the day, as reliance on foreign labour drops, this is bound to happen. The quotas have been dropping and already a few days ago there was a post on this sub about a $3500/mo dishwashing job. That kind of salary is the norm in the developed world, and as Singapore normalises away from cheap foreign labour it'll happen too."#### #### ####[]

"I think the focus is on manual laborers, not “unskilled” labours which is roughly what your example is, but the article just don’t want to be super explicit about it. \n\nGrab services for example don’t allow non-PR to work as well, so in a way it is already gatekeeped."#### #### ####[]
"the food delivery model is not sustainable of these platforms continue to charge operators north of 25% in commission. how on earth anyone is willingly doing business with them is beyond me, especially when you consider the queues most outlets have again for regular dine-in/takeaway trade.\n\nwhy anyone uses them is beyond me, I've never had food arrive actually hot. I can walk within 10 minutes to hawker center/food court whatever and bring it back home in a better condition than these platforms do and the operator doesn't need to pay commission."#### #### ####[]
"Wages too low is a supply side issue. Surely you won’t pay a Singaporean construction worker 5k if you can hire a Bangladeshi worker for a fraction. But other countries with similarly wealthy population -HK, Japan, Australia - all use their own population, and you know what? Salaries are just fine. Skilled trades in particular."#### #### ####[]
bruh.\n\nNice one#### #### ####[]
"Assuming we aren’t already bearing them. This may well be another foreign worker issue where the employers spend the bare minimum needed to feed and house the foreign workers, while keeping all the profits for themselves. So the problem may not be so much that consumers are unwilling to bear the added costs, but that the money we do pay are not flowing down to the people who need them the most. \n\nI am on the side of every Singaporean being able to earn a fair and liveable wage. Stop trying to make it seem like a “consumers vs workers” problem when really, the root cause are the fat cats who keep all the money for themselves."#### #### ####[]
"Paying them a wage they're willing to work at, despite how low it is from our perspective (SGrean's are surprisingly narrow) is fine by me. However, their living and especially working condition can and must be improved.\n\nEven if you don't feel anything for recent spate of foreign labourer deaths at their workplaces, it affects our reputation and hampers operation and productivity at the work site."#### #### ####[]

">why anyone uses them is beyond me, I've never had food arrive actually hot. I can walk within 10 minutes to hawker center/food court whatever\n\nRemember there exists many users who do not live 10 minutes' walking distance from the nearest F&B establishments.\n\nAnd there is a good correlation between disposable income and distance from hawker/kopitiam. Not always, but on average. I used to live in my relatives' landed estate, the nearest prepared F&B place was 10 minutes away *by bus*."#### #### ####[]
Except now the weather is excruciating. And it is for those grab drivers as well. Sometimes I just cook noodles w some shredded meat#### #### ####[]
"Some forms of takeaway food trave better than others. I order burritos now and then. Soups and stews travel well too. They arrive perfectly serviceable, and I'm happy to pay for the service at the current price.\n\nAs for why stalls want to pay the commission, if they have any business sense the benefit must be more the cost. Might be worth if the business could increase their kitchen output without any additional labour cost. Perhaps they are setup specifically for this business model (central kitchen with no service staff).\n\nAgree that the business model isn't sustainable though. I think they are charging me less than it costs to operate. In essence subsidising my use of the service. The problem is if they charge me more, I'd just go out and buy the food myself. Quite a dilemma unless they have some other way of extracting value."#### #### ####[]
"Interesting. I’ve always wondered why Japanese don’t outsource their manual labour. Do you think maybe singaporean got used the the extreme cheap price foreign worker can provide and hence would prioritise hiring them first? Similar to how humans as a whole got used to the convenience of plastic bags, extremely cheap and accessible."#### #### ####[]
"Not everyone owning big businesses is as decent as we thought they would be. More government interventions would help, but I don't think it's gonna be straightforward for the government to implement effective regulations for these ""fat cats"" as they've gotten used to earn extra millions with just doing the bare minimum and without crossing the legal lines. While I think it's such an asshole move, many big businesses operate more or less this way. And it's probably not going to change anytime soon.\n\nLet's not forget that these ""fat cats"" are also Singaporeans. It's not surprising if they have more bargaining power as compared to average workers or even home buyers."#### #### ####[]

"Primary beneficiaries would be commuters I think. For the Grab contractors, it’s a dead end job, like bar tending. You hit max pay pretty much immediately with no prospects - very good if that’s your maximum potential, absolutely terrible if you could have followed a career track.\n\nIf subsidies dry up and commuters won’t pay higher prices, then the younger drivers and delivery persons are likely to have wasted a good portion of their careers."#### #### ####[]
"takes longer for the food to arrive plus 9-out-10 times it arrives in a shitty condition.\n\ni walk, get some exercise, save money and eat hot food = win/win for me."#### #### ####[]
"I think it’s a perception issue. Singapore as a whole has extremely low opinion of manual labour and trades. Heck, just try to find a maker space in SG and one in HK. In HK you’re flooded with offers. SG crickets. \nJapan and Australia, skilled trades have pretty high prestige. And that does translate from the more relatable „craft“ skills like carpentry to the more mundane like electrician and plumber. \n\nMy handyman makes good money - take home at a day is several hundreds he said, and getting his time is _hard_. But yeah, in terms of social prestige probably below an admin assistant for a local SME who makes half. \n\nIm pretty sure it’s not about the cost. If you replaced 500k Bangladeshi workers with Singaporeans who earn triple, you’d likely end up with only 150k Singaporeans who use all the fancy productivity enhancing tools to get the same work done three times faster. I remember a few year ago in Japan, all the workers I saw on site used battery power tools only. Those are 5-10x more expensive, but no more pulling wires, finding / competing for outlets etc.\n\nIf there is one insurmountable obstacle I can see to hiring locals it’s the heat. That really makes at least construction super undesirable."#### #### ####[]
"As a rule of thumb, I feel that the government should be telling people what not to do, but it should not try to legislate what people should do. I have no solution to this, except for society to be more sensitive to this issue and be more willing to call out these practices of businesses underpaying their workers whenever they arise. But I don’t see us being united enough to tackle, especially when each of us are busy with our own lives and problems, and so here we are ranting about it online."#### #### ####[]

"I see. Perception is definitely something to consider and i can see myself being stereotyped like that. But if that’s the case, the move to change the perception is hard as well. If being a parents, I wouldn’t want to see my child or even my siblings suffering out there in the heat, i would then dissuade them from pursuing the craft of those tradesman and instead pursue something that is more “relaxing” white collared job. I myself wouldn’t know how to convince myself to tell my child that it’s okay to be a brick layer or a construction worker"#### #### ####[]

"If you check the [URA master plan website](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps), you would have noticed a few past master plan available for viewing, such as the 2019, 2013, 2008 and 2003 ones. But the first of the Development Guide Plans which follows this modern style, the one for 1998, is missing. Perhaps an attempt to erase the mistakes of the past, which is a shame, for the 1998 plan is quite a bit more detailed than the 2003 one.\n\nAs it turns out, it is available for viewing on the [National Archives of Singapore website](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/). Here, you get the 1998 master plan in discontinuous sections. I went to stitch up certain portions of it covering the Simpang planning area, revealing a plan that is drastically different from that of even the [commonly shared napkin sketch online](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Simpang_New_Town_%28merged%29.png).\n\nIt is interesting to note that there are no signs of MRT or LRT systems in this map, which perhaps is meant to be planned afterwards for this town. The common plot ratios here for residential areas are 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.1 and 2.5, as opposed to the 2.8 in most HDB towns, with roads further from each other while narrower than plans nowadays, suggesting that this town would have been a lot less dense than usual if it had went ahead. Perhaps it would be a nice breather from the crowds we see nowadays. Notably, is also split into 2 sections with no connections between each other; a strange design choice for a supposed town.\n\nStill, many of the design principles here seemed to have since been incorporated into newer towns. For example, linear parks along the coastline and surrounding the modified Sungei Simpang, provides residents a means to run or cycle from the periphery of the town to the Simpang Town Centre marked in blue, which are features similar to My Waterway @ Punggol in Punggol New Town, or Forest Stream and Tengah Pond in Tengah New Town. A new reclaimed island at the northern tip of the town provides a nice seaview similar to the Northshore district of Punggol, except it is even better as people living on that island would have a 360° view of waters, which is not ruined as much by the Pasir Gudang Industrial Area in Johor.\n\nIt is sure a shame that this plan did not come into fruition, but it may also be a blessing given how much of a clusterf*ck Yishun has become. Simpang would have made the crowd there worse without additional rail connections. In 2 decades’ time, come the 9th MRT line, perhaps a new generation of urban planners will reimagine the design of the last new town in Singapore built out of forests. Or perhaps the forest will continue to be conserved as a military training ground, who knows."#### #### ####[]

"> # Salaries for tech roles in S'pore set to rise, those with unique skills may be offered 'exorbitant' pay packages\n\n> SINGAPORE - With companies here tapping the same limited pool of technology talent as they step up digitalisation, particularly in the financial sector, observers say the hiring scene will remain hot even if some global tech firms - hit by business slowdown, for example - go on a recruitment freeze or downsize.\n\n> Recruitment agencies expect firms to ramp up tech hiring in the next one to two years, with pay jumps of between 15 per cent and 30 per cent, up from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]
What are unique skills in this context?#### #### ####[]
>those with unique skills may be offered 'exorbitant' pay packages\n\nUnique skills? I'm very talented in sharing the latest meme I see online with my fellow colleagues to keep them updated in the competitive meme industry#### #### ####[]
"yet more propaganda that high paying jobs aplenty, the fault lies with you because you are not qualified, not intelligent so sorry we have to import talents"#### #### ####[]
RISE ! RISE ! RISE!#### #### ####[]
"“Exorbitant” according to whom? The executive class, who *really* shouldn’t throw stones from the glass house of their disgusting total comp? Their flunkies in HR?\n\nPay people what they’re worth. Stop being bitter and resentful over it and develop a growth-oriented corporate culture."#### #### ####[]
Squeezing out smaller firms who need to go tech at the expense of bigger ones..#### #### ####[]
"In banking, kdb"#### #### ####[]
*SGAG wants to know your location!*#### #### ####[]
Good news right? On one hand ppl complain salary not going up. Then come now say squeeze out small company.#### #### ####[]
"are you insinuating that the price and supply should be controlled because the ""need[s]"" of ""smaller firms"" dominate—even nullify—the liberty of individuals with certain ostensibly scarce skills to act in their own best interest, i.e. for talent to follow the money?"#### #### ####[]
"i mean we are churning out cs grads like no tomorrow. the best will go to big tech MANGA level companies, some will go unicorns. There are bound to be bottom scrappers who will have no choice but to settle for the smaller firms. Just like how the top business grads go to IB/HF/S&T/MBB while the not so good grads will go to smaller firms."#### #### ####[]
"Free market, and if small firms can’t afford likely there will be some outsourcing firm that will be able to capture the niche."#### #### ####[]
"These are two different issues. Salary not enough is really about how our gov controls our standard of living in SG. Being paid higher than tech talents of vietnam, india, china, taiwan, and delivering similar outcomes is another. Dominated by big tech hiring and squeezing out smaller firms is the third."#### #### ####[]
No. I am all for free market but it just doesn’t work the way for small tech firms in SG right now and that’s the reality.#### #### ####[]
"We don't want engineers that can produce millions of dollars a year in value (hence why they can claim a part of this in salary) being deployed to solve small problems in small companies with smaller returns.\n\nAs harsh as it is (for the smaller firms affected), creative destruction of jobs is much better for the economy overall because it means the value produced by the economy overall increases."#### #### ####[]
"Then they just have to do more with lower calibre talents. If they can't hack it, let them die and some other service providers will just take their place and fill their niche.\n\nThere's no private sector industry that doesn't have a cluster of top tier roles paying the highest market leading salaries, and low tier roles paying rates at the bottom of the industry's pay bands."#### #### ####[]
"All big companies today that have created the monopolies which can produce a million dollar in revenue per tech hire (not value - that is completely different) started off as small companies somewhere.\n\nSingapore may choose to not ever create those companies - but then we will be sacrificing long term value over short term gains. I am not saying this is the wrong strategy, but this is the tradeoff."#### #### ####[]
"We don't have politicians having fisticuffs in our legislature. So, Singapore numba wan.\n\nIf there was ' tackle down against public opposition who dare to bring up political stances counter-arguments against current PM Lee-Hsien Loong' as you claim there is, there would be no Facebook, much less the Internet here."#### #### ####[]
"One country's politics for one's own country. I don't know how different Taiwan's democracy is compared to Singapore's, but if it works for them, great. We don't need the exact same system over here in Singapore. \n\nIt really doesn't matter if we are a democracy or not, to be honest. As long as there are capable people leading the country, any system will do."#### #### ####[]
"Successful? Maybe when viewed in comparison with SG, but democracy is often messy. Many of the things that don't get done in Taiwan are also due to China/Taiwan politics rather than the cons of democracy.\n\nThe DPP government is also not as perfect as what their green supporters sing about.\n\nI still think I would love to live there (not work), aiming to do it when I retire. GF is Taiwanese so my sources come from both reading + interaction with her."#### #### ####[]
Geopolitically both is so different.\nTaiwan relies on the grace of USA and the population is largely homogenous to the Taiwanese language. \nSingapore is a independent nation with various major racial group.\n\nThe lack of protest is not to squash dissent but unpleasantness of the act of protesting leading to riots.#### #### ####[]
Tldr: Taiwan numba 1#### #### ####[]
So many catch phrases here that I thought I'm reading a snippet from Fox News#### #### ####[]
I like Singapore's system better because shit works. \n\nIf shit doesnt work I will like their system because I can kpkb.#### #### ####[]
NO#### #### ####[]
Don't you guys have boxing matches in parliament? A bit rich coming from you lot.#### #### ####[]
Why does this look like a homework paper for Politics 101.#### #### ####[]
"Singapore is unique to other democracies. It's the 3rd longest ruling party after North Korea (1948) and China (1949). \n\nIts hold on power is due to its economic successes and public housing programme. \n\nPeople will continue voting it in giving up other semblances of democracies that the younger generation will know and want such as rights to public protest, independent media, no tax payer assisted vehicles to assist the incumbent such as PA. \n\nThere will however come a time when the older generation passes on and if the ruling party does not learn to change, it will lose power. Attempts such as hip hop are to paint an untrue image will be seen thru."#### #### ####[]
Tell that to the Taiwanese grads who are being paid peanuts. \n\nWould you rather have SG or Taiwanese govt#### #### ####[]
"Sorry, my English wasn't good enough to try to understand that wall of text."#### #### ####[]
This is r/sg not yalenus#### #### ####[]
"No, for the following reasons.\n\n1. Taiwan democracy is too polarising. This results in an overly politicised society. To me, this is a very bad thing, especially for a country like Singapore which has so many inherent faultlines.\n2. Taiwan democracy is single issue: China. This results in politicians who are not very competent being elected on that single issue. Politicians become so entrenched in this single issue that they neglect other important issues. The economy has not been doing well for almost a decade. Graduates are finding it difficult to get good jobs. Housing is becoming more and more unaffordable for everyone. Yet, regardless of the ruling parties, they are not doing much for this. In each election, the slogan is always ""台独"" or ""Taiwan Independence"". \n3. Corruption is still an issue. They ranked 25th in the corruption index. A successful democracy must also have very little corruption. There are no lack of failing democracies due to corruptions. I'm not saying that Taiwan will become one. But it also does not look that any major shift will happen in the right direction soon.\n\nTo me, a successful democracy is Switzerland. Very little corruption, politics is important but not overwhelming, voters are politically savvy, multiparty system which avoids polarising the society, competent politicians gets elected etc."#### #### ####[]
Pritnam Singh vs Lee Hsien Long would be fun to watch tho#### #### ####[]
"I don't know about you but when I look at our 4G leadership, it might be better to skip them and go straight to 5G."#### #### ####[]
"I would add that Taiwan is almost totally ethnically Han Chinese except for a \~3% aboriginal population.\n\nA messy political scene, if replicated in Singapore, will be particularly susceptible to the kinds of toxic racialized politics that plague our neighbours from up North.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the same toxic racialized players up North will definitely try to import their brand of divisive politics to willing local political players who're looking for powerful foreign backers to gain advantages."#### #### ####[]

"> # In bad taste? National Crime Prevention Council removes Amber Heard meme\n\n> SINGAPORE - The National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) has removed from its Facebook page a controversial meme featuring an image of Amber Heard from the defamation suit between the actress and her ex-husband, actor Johnny Depp.\n\n> The post, which was uploaded last Thursday (May 26) and shared 1,000 times before it was taken down on Monday night, uses a viral moment from Heard's testimony about Depp conducting a ""cavity search"" on her - sexually assaulting her with his fingers after accusing her of hiding his drugs.\n\n> While recounting what happened following the incident, Heard winces and says her dog stepped on a bee and had to be taken to a veterinarian.\n\n> The NCPC's meme used Heard's wincing face but replaced her line of ""My dog stepped on a bee"" with other one-liners that rhyme with ""bee"". Similar memes have been appeared on meme sites like SGAG, where one such TikTok video received over 16,800 likes.\n\n> The NCPC apologised for the post on Tuesday night. In a statement, it said: ""We had used the photo as we thought the expression captured how members of the public might react when they spot the various signs of scams. It was not our intention to demean or insult anyone. We apologise for the post and any offence caused, and will do better in our efforts to outreach to Singaporeans about scams.""\n\n> Gender advocacy group Aware warned that such jokes and memes about the Depp-Heard trial, regardless of its outcome, can harm survivors of domestic violence.\n\n> In response to ST queries, Ms Kelly Leow, senior communications manager at Aware, says the ""sheer ubiquity"" of social media content about the trial makes it ""practically impossible for survivors to go even one day without encountering such content online"".\n\n> She adds: ""Those who have experienced domestic violence themselves would likely be re-traumatised by witnessing scenes from the trial itself, in which acts of violence are detailed at length, and also by the outpouring of callous jokes surrounding the trial.""\n\n> Ms Rachel Lim, 29, a survivor of intimate partner abuse, has been ""troubled"" by the deluge of social media content about the defamation case.\n\n> ""The verdict is not even out yet and even if it was, this is in very bad taste,"" the content strategist says.\n\n> She adds: ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But when you share or create a meme you have to understand your own intentions - are you trying to create a more peaceful world or are you trying to direct hate towards somebody?""\n\n> Ms Leow adds that the way that this trial has been presented in the media and on social media tends to erase nuances, turning a complicated situation into a black-and-white, he versus she narrative.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

Better to get head than to get heard.#### #### ####[]
"I wouldn’t be surprised they actually do believe Amber Heard is being honest in her testimony. \n\nFor many, the idea that women can actually lie is a abhorrent myth that incels created to discredit real victims. \n\n#believeallwomen"#### #### ####[]
"Because the whole Anglosphere internet and mass media has been going on and on about ""#metoo"" and ""#believeallwomen"" for decades, and this trial is a very public and very good example of why unconditionally and uncritically believing *any* demographic's accusations is a terrible idea."#### #### ####[]
Memes + humans love gossip#### #### ####[]
This isn't a petty squabble between two celebrities. How are domestic violence and false accusations just Hollywood nonsense?#### #### ####[]
"because we can picture, with all its publicity, how difficult it is for male victims to reclaim their lives and move forwards, and even then we need to walk on eggshells around the female aggressor because it would be tasteless. \n\nAware would have more credibility if they came down hard on women who lie and play the victims."#### #### ####[]
To be honest my life’s been pretty vanilla lately so that shit has been entertaining for me 😂#### #### ####[]
">Rife discussion on girls serving NS for equality\n\nAware has long advocated for NS for both genders, to the best fit of each individual. Fyi"#### #### ####[]
Not if the head is coming from Heard#### #### ####[]
">I wouldn’t be surprised they actually do believe Amber Heard is being honest in her testimony. \n\nAs a guy, this is for the Court to decide, not the public."#### #### ####[]

How do you guys wash whirt formal working shirt?\n\nThis is the 2nd time I keep ruining mine and will be my third time having to purchase the same colour shirt for work (I like white because it matches with any tie colour). I work in office so I know when mine gets dirty from any external factor. This is my third white shirt that gets stained. \n\nFirst time I suspected was from washing machine. So I stopped washing white using washing machine and opted to hand wash. Every wash I would make sure that I wash the basin I use. I also just use a normal liquid detergent. \n\nCould it be from the place I hang my clothes? :/#### #### ####[]

"But they charge a separate excess for own damage and for third-party liability. So if you cause another vehicle to be damaged then you have to pay both. That's the hidden cost of using a car that you don't own. This is typical market practice for any rental car, whether it is a car sharing or a traditional daily rental company.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, if you get into trouble using your own car and are covered by a comprehensive policy, you only pay one excess for everything (own damage + third party claims against your policy), which is usually in the hundreds rather than in the thousands if you are in a 'normal' risk group.\n\nEven if you are a very careful driver, your risk of getting into an at-fault accident (even an 80/20 in your favour!) is substantial enough to necessarily consider the above. There are enough fuckwits behind wheels on our roads.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: [https://membership.bluesg.com.sg/terms-and-conditions/10may2022gp/](https://membership.bluesg.com.sg/terms-and-conditions/10may2022gp/)\n\nScroll to bottom.

"> # Muis instructs halal certificate holders here to stop importing meat from Australian abattoir\n\n> SINGAPORE - The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) has asked halal certificate holders here to stop importing meat from an Australian abattoir, after it found problems with its products.\n\n> The council has found reasonable grounds to conclude that Thomas Foods International Lobethal (TFIL) has compromised the halal integrity of the meat, it said on Tuesday (May 31).\n\n> This means that the meat from TFIL is not considered halal, and is not fit for consumption under Muslim law.\n\n> Muis said: ""Our findings are based on established facts and inputs from competent authorities."" It did not specify what the grounds were.\n\n> It also said it is in contact with certificate holders who have been importing meat from TFIL to obtain alternative halal-compliant supplies.\n\n> It added that it will be conducting checks to ensure compliance by its certificate holders, and stressed that any use of non-halal compliant supplies would be in breach of Muis halal standards.\n\n> On May 16, Muis said in a Facebook post that it was investigating allegations against TFIL, after the Malaysian authorities suspended a slaughtering approval granted to it.\n\n> The Straits Times understands that imports from TFIL amount to only a portion of imported meat from Australia, and that the supply of halal meat to Muis-certified establishments will not be adversely impacted.\n\n> Malaysian media outlets had reported earlier in May that the suspension of approval followed alleged violations of halal slaughtering procedures.\n\n> Muis had said then that it was working with the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to ascertain relevant information on TFIL from the Australian Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment.\n\n> It had also said that the abattoir is accredited by the SFA to export meat to Singapore.\n\n> In a Facebook post on Tuesday, the head of the council halal supply network, Mr Sharifuddin Mohamed Ali, reiterated Muis' findings, and thanked the Muslim community for its understanding on the matter.\n\n> ""Muis is highly committed to maintaining the integrity of the supply of halal food to the Singapore Muslim community, and will continue to provide updates and advice to the community in this respect,"" he said.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

"Many might think that injuries like these are part and parcel of martial arts training - but it's actually not. I used to be a (small-time) coaching assistant and whenever we had practice bouts with seniors/coaches, the stronger/more experienced folks would hold back a little. The focus is on honing skill and technique, not to dominate over your opponent - especially since *you're training with a fellow teammate, not a competitor.* The article states this point very clearly as well.\n\nAt national level especially, it seems incredibly silly to put your athletes at risk of injury in this manner."#### #### ####[]

There are edges to the pads yknow#### #### ####[]
"With regards to pad-work with strikes from pad-holder, I think this short [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paCHXpVCBAA) would give you an idea of how intense it might get depending on the goal of the session, this one being fight team selection where durability and mettle would be sorely tested. It is possible to take the short hard edge of the pad to your face, something akin to receiving a stiff jab. Personal experience wise at a previous gym, I have been kneed twice, as well as teeped across the mat (i'm really light, so I tend to take involuntary flight...) during padwork. I didn't really notice if I got any bruises, but the strikes certainly knocked the wind out of me of a couple of seconds. Then I simply got back up and resume the padwork session.\n\n*The one thing about MT training is that progression of training is a very subtle thing, and seldom spelt out verbally. Instructors would observe their batch of students and remember those who have shown potential. Then one day, they would test out the student with a pad-strike and see their reaction. Students just wanting to clock a fitness session would be totally spooked by the strike and it really shows on their face, then the instructor would revert back to not testing that student so much. On the other hand, if you actually took the strike in your stride and so much as react with a grin on your face, your instructor would smile back, and yes from then on, your padwork sessions will be... a little more interesting. It really is that subtle.*\n\n**However, this reply isn't meant to throw shade on the Lena's account, but more about sharing how a padholder may evolve the padwork session to simulate fight conditions.** The investigation would likely shed more light on the specific details of that hard session, such as: what was the exact nature of that physical assessment, did the coach harbour any ill will, accounts from 3rd party observations where available, were the strikes thrown outside of the actual padwork session (?!), etc.\n\nHope this can be resolved definitively, as I really want to see our MT athletes shine on the global stage without getting mired by such incidents."#### #### ####[]

"> # Section 377A should not be repealed now: Singapore Archbishop William Goh\n\n> Singapore should not repeal Section 377A, which criminalises sex between men, under present circumstances, Archbishop William Goh said on Tuesday (18 September).\n\n> In a pastoral letter posted on the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore’s website, he also wrote that he would not object to a repeal of the law “if it were merely aimed at removing all potential criminal penalties against homosexuals”.\n\n> “However, until and unless Parliament puts in place a formulation that more perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the law, guaranteeing the protection of the rights of the majority who favour the traditional family, and that no further demands be made to legalise same-sex unions, same-sex adoption of babies, surrogacy, or to criminalise those who do not support the homosexual lifestyle, I am of the view that S377A should not be repealed under the present circumstances,” he added.\n\n> The debate over Section 377A was reignited in recent days after the Indian Supreme Court’s decision earlier this month to strike down a similar law and a top Singapore diplomat urged a challenge to the gay sex ban.\n\n> Petitions have since been started by activists on both sides of the divide, with religious groups weighing in, and a deejay filing a fresh legal challenge. Most Singaporeans still support keeping the ban, a survey showed.\n\n> Minister for Law and Home Affairs K. Shanmugam had said that any decision on 377A is a matter for Parliament. Depending on the legislation, public opinion is “often relevant” during policy making in Parliament, he added.\n\n> Education Minister Ong Ye Kung has also weighed in on the issue, stressing that there is no discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community “at work, housing (and) education” in Singapore.\n\n> In his message, Archbishop Goh touched on the dilemma he is facing over the debate.\n\n> “On one hand, I feel the struggles and pains of those with same-sex attraction, who sincerely love God and desire to live up to His divine plan for humanity,” he wrote.\n\n> “On the other hand, I share the anxieties and fears of those who subscribe to the traditional and scriptural views of marriage and family, that repealing S377A would lead the country down a slippery slope,” he added.\n\n> Nonetheless, he is of the view that Section 377A should not be repealed because “by accepting homosexual acts as a social norm, the dreadful consequences for the stability of our families, the well-being of our children, and the risks to the common good will be long-term and irreversible”.\n\n> He ended his letter with: “Looking at the dire consequences for countries which normalised same-sex unions and the ramifications that followed, may we not repeat the mistake that others have made!

"Poor xavier who post so much better & useful content only to be labeled as ""S'porean influencer"""#### #### ####[]
"> # S'porean influencer easily extracts own information from 2 well-known companies to reveal cyber security flaws\n\n> You may better know Xavier Lur as a lifestyle personality on Twitter, but the 28-year-old recently put up content that is quite different this time.\n\n> On May 28, 2022, Lur uploaded a series of Instagram Stories, detailing his successful attempts at extracting personal information from two companies.\n\n> ""It is concerning that there are many brands out there who don't take customer personal data seriously,"" he wrote, sharing an incident where local fashion label Love, Bonito had its customer information leaked after a malicious code was added to its website.\n\n> On May 24, 2022, about two years after the breach, the fashion brand updated customers that ""significant improvements"" have been made to their data security systems, in addition to a continual reevaluation of their IT frameworks and processes.\n\n> For the purpose of not landing himself in hot soup, Lur only retrieved his own information.\n\n> He added that the security loopholes have also been reported to the companies—which he will not be naming—two months ago.\n\n> Company A\n\n> The first company that Lur ""hacked"" is a ""well-known brand"" with operations in both Singapore and overseas markets.\n\n> According to him, anyone with ""basic technological knowledge"" would have been able to access its customers' data, such as name, phone number, date of birth, and email.\n\n> A screenshot with Lur's personal information blurred out accompanied the Instagram Story.\n\n> It would also be possible to extract the entire database of customer information and store them in a file, although Lur did not attempt to do so.\n\n> Besides the company, the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC), Singapore’s ""main authority"" when it comes to personal data protection, has also been alerted to the security flaw.\n\n> Company B\n\n> The second company that Lur acted on is also a ""well-known local brand"".\n\n> The case for this appears to be slightly more serious, as it pertains to financial side of things.\n\n> With the customers' MPGS' (Mastercard Payment Gateway Services) username and password exposed in the company's android app (which anyone can download), it is possible for several things to happen, as Lur illustrated with several examples.\n\n> For instance, a hacker or third party could:\n\n> Trigger unauthorised transactions using the customers' saved credit card\n\n> Initiate a refund to the customer even when goods and services have been fulfilled by the company\n\n> Retrieve credit card information from the saved token on the app\n\n> There is, however, the question of OTPs (one-time password), which Lur did not address in his Stories.\n\n> More susceptible to information loss than we realise\n\n> David Koh, the Chief Executive of Singapore’s Cyber Security Agency (CSA), previously explained how complacency may lead Singaporeans to conflate physical security and cybersecurity.\n\n> While Singapore is a relatively safe country to live in, one may ""falsely [equate] our relatively good physical security with cybersecurity.""\n\n> He made the additional observation that one knows immediately when they are a victim of crime in the physical domain, but may not realise right away that one's personal or even financial information has been stolen.\n\n> ""We don't feel the impact directly to ourselves, because even when your data is 'lost', it's not lost, because you still have your data. The hacker has copied your data out.""\n\n> In the physical domain, however, if you lose your wallet, you've lost it,"" Koh stated matter-of-factly.\n\n> Related article\n\n> Top image via Xavier Lur's Instagram page\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

"Because the incidents that usually happened have minor direct effect to the customer and therefore typically do not have a noticeable effect on their business.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, not implying that this is overall a minor negligible thing, what i mean is from a company perspective it doesn’t affect the customers directly in the sense that they would forget or at least would not associate the effect of the breach to the company and therefore if they refuse to use it today, next month they would come back, and some other customer would consider it something like sunk cost (the breached has happened, stopping to use it doesn’t undo the breach)."#### #### ####[]

Before starting the route, he checked the vehicle to ensure it was in safe working order.\n\n> Loo had reversed out of his parking lot and was driving along Bukit Batok Interchange when he approached the stop line at a T-junction. However, he failed to stop.\n\n> He continued driving and turned right into the junction without keeping a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles that had the right of way.\n\n> At the same time, another Tower Transit bus was entering the interchange from the main road. Loo failed to give way to this bus, which was travelling from his left to his right.\n\n> Loo collided with the other bus, causing it to topple to the left, fall down a slope and land on its left side. He also admitted to stepping on the accelerator lightly before the collision.\n\n> The impact of the other bus uprooted the roadside fencing at the accident site. The other bus also collided into a bus captain who was taking a break at the lower pavement at the bottom of the slope.\n\n> The incident was captured in photos and security camera footage that were circulated online. Videos of the incident were played in court on Tuesday.\n\n> All 14 injured people were taken to the hospital.

"Parent here. In Singapore, there is no culture of ensuring child safety while travelling in a car both among parents and the authorities. A majority of my parent friends keep their child in their arms or in a baby carrier when in a car. They think it’s fine if the driver is safe. The problem is not the driver though. Can you guarantee other that other road users will drive safely?\n\nTaxis don’t care because they’re not legally obliged to have a car seat while plying the roads. Private hire cars won’t accept your booking if you don’t have your own seat. \n\nThese days you can easily get a foldable car seat such as the Urban Kanga for toddlers or the MiFold booster for older children not tall enough to use the car seatbelt. As for babies, there aren’t good solutions except a travel system stroller where the car seat and function as the pram seat if it clips onto the pram frame. It’s still pretty bulky. \n\nI have to argue with my parents to use a car seat whenever they drive with my child. It’s really ridiculous."#### #### ####[]

Costco scenera next is can be less than $50 in the US but is ridiculously priced in SG… but still slightly cheaper . some people also sell it second hand after travelling . But it’s a hard frame so need to make sure it has not been checked in as luggage too many times and no longer safe \n\nAt around 3 it might be more worth it to be on the look out for second hand mifold or ride safer vest… lots of mifold knock offs around. Once I scored an older generation ride safer vest at under 100.#### #### ####[]
There’s being overzealous and then there is total disregard. I think best practices is somewhere in between but that’s just my personal opinion. \n\nFact is cars today are already waaaaaaay more safer than in the past. Sure we can make it even safer but let’s not pretend that not enforcing seatbelts and booster seats for kids is causing multiple preventable deaths and serious injuries that Singapore is suffering from right now.#### #### ####[]
later really become angel#### #### ####[]
A wise man once said 'What could possibly go wrong?'#### #### ####[]
"* While Singapore’s road fatality rate of 1.49 per 100,000 citizens is low, the road fatalities per vehicle is still relatively high. Using this measure, Singapore fares unfavourably with countries like Japan, UK, Australia and Canada. This indicates that while Singapore sees fewer road accidents compared to its peers, the accidents are more severe.*\n\nhttps://www.budgetdirect.com.sg/car-insurance/research/road-accident-statistics-in-singapore\n\nInteresting to see SG compares well in terms of road fatalities per capita but worse in terms of fatalities per vehicle."#### #### ####[]
I think you have a very different take on things than me. \n\nCars are waaaaaaay safer for an occupant wearing a seatbelt for whom airbags and crumple zones work effectively. \nModern cars are not inherently way safer for an unrestrained occupant - the occupant’s crumple zones have remained unchanged#### #### ####[]
"Doesn’t breakdown to kids being restrained vs unrestrained. \n\nAlso, might be due to our higher bike usage + unrestrained foreign worker transports. \n\nBut I’m just throwing shit out of my arse so don’t think too much about it."#### #### ####[]
"I totally agree with you re: seatbelt etc makes thing safer don’t get me wrong. \n\nI’m just asking so what? \n\nIs there a car accident pandemic where many unrestrained kids are dying/injured such that it’s a problem that require the G to enforce safety standards to be 100% adhered to? \n\nWhere is the urgency and do you have the stats to show it? Also, a relevant fact is that government is obviously comfortable with the risk to allow kids to have no booster seats in taxis. \n\nYes there is risk, but clearly the problem might be bigger in your head vs reality."#### #### ####[]
Let’s not mention unrestrained passengers in the back of work vehicles#### #### ####[]
You’re probably right - I have recently returned from abroad and have seen zero tolerance policing of safety restraints in the west. \n\nIt’s a very jarring difference - maybe road safety is an area where SG measures itself against local neighbours instead of global peers?#### #### ####[]
Jo Teo approves - not one of them came to her and asked her for better and safer transport.#### #### ####[]
"Regardless who we benchmark against I would like to ask once more, where’s the urgency?"#### #### ####[]
"You can make that argument for anything, until it’s too late"#### #### ####[]
"And the reverse is also true isn’t it? \n\nLet’s do EVERYTHING JUST IN CASE IT IS TOO LATE.\n\nSo instead of being disingenuous, present your case why this is a serious problem that we should change how we are doing things. \n\nI personally can’t see why things are ok now but suddenly 10 years down the road we’ll suddenly have a slew of kids dying in numerous car accidents just because we have not been enforcing kids wearing seatbelts and booster seats. \n\nSomehow in your view this is possible, please explain why and how."#### #### ####[]
Simple: We currently enforce other traffic laws with negligible societal costs (eg parking enforcement outside commercial areas). Why would we prioritise those over road safety measures with a direct societal and economic cost?\n\nNote Economic costs of child injury is far greater than that for adults given longer lifetimes over which costs (including productivity costs to the individual and their families) may manifest.\n\nI personally believe it’s worth enforcing existing road safety laws in the manner of other first world nations. Singapore’s failure to do so indicates an unexpected (to me) prioritisation. \n\nShort of conducting a study that’s about the best you’ll get at 9pm on a Tuesday.#### #### ####[]
"I don’t think you answered my question - I said where’s the urgency, you said if we don’t do it now it will be too late, implying that if we don’t start enforcing now we’ll see an increase number of kids injured/killed because reasons.\n\nI asked what is these reasons and you totally didn’t give any, but start to ramble about kids getting killed/injured having economic cost. \n\nWhy would us not doing anything different from now will lead to greater pandemic of kids having even more number of vehicular related accidents in the future???? \n\nReality disagree with you lady - despite G not enforcing the number of fatalities and injuries are getting lower not higher…. Once again, let me reiterate that the problem is bigger in your head than it really is.\n\nAnd lastly, I’ll just summarise my position and forever stay silent on this topic - not my hill to die on - I fully agree with you that safety is great, and one can easily do more to with at very little cost to improve safety. \n\nHOWEVER, to start doing draconian enforcement to ensure high level of compliance - why??? Where is the fire??? How many kids are we losing each year due to this non-compliance??? Why would anybody sane want to advocate even greater government oversight on something that is literally not an issue? \n\nFFS you are an expat, I’m gonna assume from the western world and I’m surprised you actually want more stricter regulation and enforcement? I thought SG government oversight is already too draconian for most of you guys.\n\nP.S. FWIW it’s as strict in SG as other countries - I’ve lived in NYC and London and even though it’s a must to have child seat rarely do you get stopped by police because of this - that’s if you bump into them even. Trust me if traffic police in SG see kids jumping around they’ll likely pull you over. \n\nYou guys in the western world aren’t doing this because of greater police state, it’s because you guys believe in it. Simply put, many people here don’t share that same risk assessment as you guys, and honestly I don’t see a huge difference in stats either way."#### #### ####[]
"What’s the urgency in enforcing drug laws? Urgency is not the right criteria. \n\nYou win an internet argument based on your own tortured, contrived criteria. Bravo."#### #### ####[]
"No my dear, but if you want to CHANGE something then obviously there needs to be a stimulant/catalyst that is changing the current situation. \n\nP.S. there was an urgency to enact strict drug laws back when we were getting independent. Btw Boat Quay was full of opium dens until we outlawed that. \n\nSo yes, from no strict drug laws to strict drug law there was something urgent. But obviously there’s nothing urgent now for us to change how we enforce drugs now is there? So everything stays the same. \n\nSo tell me again where the urgency to change how we enforce kids wearing seatbelts?\n\nP.P.S. my dear you are the one that brought up timeframe as a factor when you said “too late”, hence I said urgency…."#### #### ####[]
"Your argument is confused. I am not calling for new laws a la your opium parallel. I am asking why current laws are not enforced, not to change those laws. That’s where your parallel falls apart. \n\nWhat was the urgency that promoted government action to draft and pass seatbelt laws in 2011? I would argue there was none more significant than exists today thus the case for enforcement remains unchanged. \n \nAgain, I am not arguing to change the laws. I asked \n1) why are parents so dismissive of their children’s safety (speculative) and \n2) are there laws and are they just not enforced (since confirmed). \n\nYou have contrived a call for change of laws - that’s on you, sweet summer child."#### #### ####[]
"You are calling more new enforcement…..\n\nI’m asking why. \n\nYou said because if not it may be too late.\n\nI asked why so urgent? \n\nImagine being a foreign Karen asking why local police aren’t being enthusiastically enforcing a law that literally isn’t hurting anybody one else, people ain’t dying and no significant statistically difference noted. In a country which most western world regard as draconian to boot. \n\nPls. If anything you’re the naive one thinking that the reason people are using child seatbelts is because of strict enforcement in your home country. I’ve lived in UK and US and I’ve rarely seen traffic police doing anything more than speed traps. It’s not as if your police is strictly enforcing child seats but simply using it as an added reason for racial motivated harassment on the roads. \n\nRegardless - not much difference anyway isn’t it - stop clutching pearls over non-events. But sure be my guest to gloat and say “I told you so” in the event we lose our next generation in the upcoming carpocalypse that you say will come if we dont start enforcing stricter safety rules.\n\nRemindMe! 5 years"#### #### ####[]
Don’t be facetious. You’re not engaging in an honest consideration of the questions posed in the OP - you’re just trolling to feel some attention. \n\nCops in the UK and Australia issue seatbelt-related fines based on my anecdotal knowledge of people copping them (one in the UK based on a picture from a speed camera). Are you presuming they’re examples of racially motivated harassment?\n\nThey’re even installing seatbelt detecting cameras in one Aussie state after having success with mobile phone use detecting cameras. Do you suppose those cameras are racist too?\n\nNativity is hard to spot in one’s self.#### #### ####[]
"Lol u from down under mate? \n\nYes I agree with Australia that’s the only place I’ve driven where traffic laws are sacred.\n\nLol I hope you do see the irony regarding oneself, spotting and naivety. \n\nObviously the thing about racial motivated harassment is said in jest as a cheeky jab…. you’re clearly taking this way too seriously. \n\nBut come on, surely you can see what I’ve been desperately trying to show you thus far - why is an ang moh woman clutching pearls about Asian kids not wearing seat belts even though she is unable to show that the doomsday outcome that she’s trying to help us prevent? Gosh the folly of Asian stupidity, if only we have more white saviour teaching us how to live better. \n\nOh wait, white saviour wants more police action? Dafuq? I thought you guys want LESS police action…. Now I’m confused. Must be cuz my Asian sweet summer child logic is too convoluted lol. Oh sorry, I meant my naivety. \n\nAnyway what’s the next clutching pearls event for you, ban abortion in SG? Economic cost of not having enough babies in SG is pretty high as you must’ve known. Thought that might be of interest to you since you seem to have strong opinions about actions of others that literally do not have anything to do with yourself and are risky but mostly harmless.\n\nP.S. not trolling but again I don’t see why this is such a pain point for you - I see kids never wear seat belt I must make a post and ask Whyyyyyy…. Oh the humanity…… clutch clutch clutch. Unfortunately you met me, where I tend to clutch pearls when I see others clutching pearls. Lol we deserve each other."#### #### ####[]

"It's obviously a joke. A joke without even a kernel of truth, made on a show that usually specialises in social commentary, is a dumb joke. Even more so when public perception of water recycling via reverse osmosis is already poor in the US, and instead of helping he's just making it worse.\n\nThis is a guy who tries really hard to portray himself as a progressive who cares about environmental and social issues, but when talking about solutions to water scarcity in places like San Diego, is quite happy to jump on the 'toilet to tap' train. And yes, people in the US actually unironically deride RO water as 'toilet to tap'."#### #### ####[]

California is investing a ton in potable recycled water. It’s already being used and will be part of the drinking supply soon.#### #### ####[]
"It's ironic that you ended up being the one who has no knowledge of the country you are criticizing. \n \nHalf of their country are deserts. They have been moving massively towards recycled water with billions already pledged by congress to build infrastructures unlike our own. \n \nAnd remember that Singaporeans didn't accept NEWater right away either. In fact, many were resistant to the idea of drinking ""toilet water"", so I have no idea where you get that higher than thou attitude about other countries."#### #### ####[]
What distress?#### #### ####[]
"“This time it’s chickens, next time it can be something else.”\n\nKeep calm and carry on, people."#### #### ####[]
"Distress? I’m paying a bit more if I want to buy fresh, and the same if I go for frozen chicken… \n\nI’m sure the same is true for most Singaporeans, minus our poor hawkers. Having said that, the real distress will be the what Malaysian farmers, and Malaysians feel in the future.\n\nHere, it’s a matter of pivoting supply sources. We are no strangers to that, having done so repeatedly whenever our Malaysian neighbours pull the same stunt (pork exports in 1999, seafood in 2019, eggs in 2004 and 2018, now chicken in 2022). The only consequence was supply disruption for 1-3 months, coupled with higher prices, then its business as usual. What usually happens in Malaysia though would be smaller exporters going out of business.\n\nThis is going to be especially acute here since abang has instituted a price cap for almost 2 years, this coupled with rising feed prices and now an export ban will surely kill off the smaller-scale farmers who are already struggling, causing a further dip in available supplies. \n\nWhat worries me is more the political instability that inevitably follows when the food supply is in doubt (French Revolution of 1789, Venezuela 2014, South Sudan 2017, Yemen 2018 etc etc). This will be especially acute as Malaysia is also experiencing rapid currency devaluation as the Malaysian Ringgit is dropping to historical lows, affecting its ability to rely on imports to alleviate the situation. \n\nWhy should we care? Well, I have lots of friends and family in Malaysia, the same as many Singaporeans. Any suffering if their people is suffering of me and mine too when it comes down to it. Secondly, political instability in our neighbours is ultimately going to be bad for stability in the region and thus bad for business, which will affect our livelihoods, one way or the other.\n\nSo while we have fun bashing Malaysian politics and the stupid policies, please spare a thought for the common people. 🙏🏻"#### #### ####[]

">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia will stop exporting chickens from Wednesday in a protectionist move to bolster domestic food supply, sparking distress in neighboring Singapore where chicken rice is a national dish. \n> \n> \n> \n>Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced last week that, beginning June 1, Malaysia will ban exports of 3.6 million chickens a month until domestic prices and production stabilize. The move is felt most in Singapore, which sources a third of its poultry from Malaysia. \n> \n> \n> \n>Almost all the chickens are imported live to Singapore, where they are slaughtered and chilled. Singapore consumers have been rushing to stock up on fresh chicken ahead of the ban, with local media reporting that shelves in some wet markets and supermarkets have been cleared of poultry. \n> \n> \n> \n>The Singapore Straits Times said chicken sellers predicted the cost of chilled chicken could rise by up to 30%, sending chicken dish prices soaring. The Singapore government has urged consumers to switch to frozen chicken and other alternative meats, and is exploring new markets for fresh chicken. \n> \n> \n> \n>But there is concern over the fate of the ubiquitous chicken rice that is sold everywhere from hawker stalls to top hotels. Popular eatery Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, which gets its poultry entirely from Malaysia, reportedly said it will introduce pork and seafood dishes instead of using frozen chicken if it fails to find new suppliers. \n> \n>Malaysia’s protectionist move comes as countries worldwide grapple with soaring food prices, fueled partly by the Ukraine war. Ukraine is a major exporter of corn and grains that are key components of chicken feed. India has restricted sugar and wheat exports, while Indonesia temporarily halted — and then lifted — palm oil sales abroad. \n> \n> \n> \n>Apart from the export ban, Malaysia also abolished import permits for chicken and other foods to boost food supply and curb prices amid public anger. It has earlier capped chicken prices and allocated subsidies for farmers squeezed by rising cost of chicken feed, partly caused by a weakening Malaysian currency. \n> \n> \n> \n>The export ban came as a surprise by Ismail’s government, which took power in August and faces a general election next year. The government is also investigating claims that cartels are controlling the price and supply of chicken. \n> \n> \n> \n>The ban not only caused alarm in Singapore but also troubled smaller Malaysian poultry farmers who supply to Singapore to help keep their operations afloat. The government didn’t say how long the export ban will last, but officials expect supply and prices to normalize within a month."#### #### ####[]

We have been self-sufficient in water since 2016... Since then we've built 3 more desalination plants.

"> # Bukit Batok bus collision: Former Tower Transit driver jailed six weeks\n\n> SINGAPORE - A Tower Transit bus driver who caused 14 people to be injured after driving his vehicle into another bus at Bukit Batok Bus Interchange was jailed six weeks on Tuesday (May 31).\n\n> Singapore permanent resident Loo Eng Chai, 66, was also disqualified from driving for five years after he pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous hurt to six people by committing a negligent act during the incident which happened on July 11 last year.\n\n> Among those who were grievously hurt was the driver of the other bus, Mr Mohammed Salleh Mian, 65, and Mr Alias Mokson, 57, a bus captain who was taking a break in the interchange when the incident happened.\n\n> Another charge of causing hurt to eight passengers in Mr Salleh's bus by committing a negligent act was taken into consideration during his sentencing.\n\n> The incident last July saw the bus driven by Mr Mohammed Salleh end up on its side following the collision.\n\n> Deputy Public Prosecutor Chee Ee Ling told the court on Tuesday that Loo, who had been working as a bus driver since 2000, failed to stop at a stop line and turned right without keeping a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles.\n\n> He collided into the right side of Mr Salleh's bus, which had the right of way. The collision caused Mr Salleh's bus to topple and fall onto a slope.\n\n> All 14 victims - including 13 in Mr Salleh's bus - were taken to hospital following the incident.\n\n> DPP Chee asked that Loo be jailed for six to eight weeks and be disqualified from driving for five years.\n\n> Loo, who was unrepresented, said in mitigation that he is currently working as a cleaner and needed to support his family, who are living in Johor Baru, Malaysia.\n\n> Tower Transit had said previously that he had been dismissed from his job.\n\n> For causing grievous hurt by committing a negligent act, Loo could have been jailed for up to two years, fined up to $5,000, or both.\n\n> For causing hurt by committing a negligent act, he could have been jailed for up to six months, fined up to $2,500, or both.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

but u can change ur system time to backdate it. if u r first published it upranks u. this has happened too consistently to b possible to update articles. its more likely an attempt to cheat its way up. but haha whey can see many mothership accounts trying to shift discussions hahah#### #### ####[]

again none are published so sldnt have this#### #### ####[]

It’s cheating themselves down, not up.\n\nIMO its either a mistake on the date, they updated a previous article with a new headline, they intentionally want to have less viewers, or they have no idea how SEO works and unintentionally sabotaged themselves."#### #### ####[]
Ya as in douche bag. \n\nI remember there being a post made here about meeting local celebs (can try and find the link if you want) and a commenter mentioned about how uptight and curt he was when he/she met him.

Actually have you considered that maybe the error is from Google instead?#### #### ####[]
again this is not the first instance this has happened. each time this happens the likes of st and cna etc will appear behind them when keywords are searched#### #### ####[]
so recurring errors from google just for MS? hahaha improbable whey. but nice defence from team mothership#### #### ####[]
"Ok, seems like you can’t be convinced. Can you share why you believe such a “manipulation” would increase their search rankings? Any reason why Google would value their article more?"#### #### ####[]
You just need to do some googling to know that Google tries to take the date from the content. Why don't you try to do the same in [Bing](https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=Dee+Kosh+pleads+guilty+to+sexual+offences+involving+2+teenage+boys&FORM=HDRSC6)?#### #### ####[]
"I have also seen date errors in Google search with Reddit threads. Several times some commenters post screenshot of content that have earlier dates to ""expose"" the content as reposts, but if you actually click the link, it links back to the same thread (i.e. no reposting happened and the dates on Google search were simply wrong)"#### #### ####[]
"nah i stand corrected if im wrong. \n\nthe fact is that if u use the keywords to search, MS article will be higher - in each instance something similar to this happens - in other words its “time to market” upranks. this despite the other publications actually going earlier. and having more inferred traffic based on social media interactions"#### #### ####[]
yes and if u open the content its actually on the date of news. but its on search this goes back in time. it cannot be that u take from an internal management system an unpublished time ba#### #### ####[]
"I think Google don't necessarily can find the date unless the publisher specifically write it based on Google's suggested format (I don't really understand this HTML stuff). But most likely Google took the date from the link at the right side of the page (the events portion got write 26-May). That's why can only see this in Google and not in Bing.\n\nI'm not supporting Mothership or anything lah. Seriously I'm just bored at home on MC, nothing to do, so try to find out lor."#### #### ####[]
from where i see link and publication timings are all consistent on May 30 at 335pm. its only on search this becomes May 26. anyway haha its also some curious shit digging im doing because of the shitty stuff but all’s cool#### #### ####[]

"> # Man jailed for misappropriating S$343,000 from Gleneagles Hospital, forging patients' signatures\n\n> SINGAPORE: A manager at Gleneagles Hospital misappropriated more than S$343,000 from his employer by amending patients' bills and pocketing their cash refunds, forging some patients' signatures in order to avoid detection.\n\n> Thomas Ng Eng How, 48, was on Tuesday (May 31) jailed for three years and nine months after pleading guilty to one amalgamated charge of criminal breach of trust by an employee and eight charges of forgery.\n\n> Another 30 similar charges were considered for sentencing.\n\n> The offences, which took place from 2016 to 2018, were only discovered through an extensive audit on Gleneagles Hospital and other facilities under Parkway Hospitals Singapore.\n\n> Auditors noticed a large amount of cash refunds issued by Gleneagles Hospital as a result of Ng's actions, and the hospital made a police report in January 2018.\n\n> As a business office manager, Ng was able to make amendments to patients' bills in the hospital's computer system, although he was instructed to first obtain his superiors' authorisation.\n\n> During his employment, Ng learnt that the hospital had a practice of offering patients discounts or bill reductions by downgrading their hospital beds from time to time.\n\n> The discounts and reductions were implemented by amending the patient's bill. This could be done even after the bill had been fully paid and the patient discharged. The patient would then be issued a cash refund.\n\n> Ng saw in this an opportunity to misappropriate cash belonging to the hospital, the court heard.\n\n> Each month, he would identify bills involving patients who were foreigners, that were not covered by any insurance, and that amounted to more than S$30,000.\n\n> He selected these patients as he believed they were unlikely to return to Gleneagles Hospital as often as local patients, and less likely to discover that cash refunds had been issued in their name.\n\n> After these patients had made full payment to the hospital and been discharged, Ng would amend their bills to reduce the final amounts or instruct his subordinates to do so.

"> # Retail investors should steer clear of crypto even as S'pore addresses risks without stifling innovation: DPM Heng\n\n> SINGAPORE - Crypto assets like cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are constantly evolving and highly risky but have the potential to transform the future of finance, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Tuesday (May 31).\n\n> He warned that retail investors should steer clear of cryptocurrencies even as Singapore adapts its rules to address the key risks that crypto assets pose.\n\n> ""Retail investors especially should steer clear of cryptocurrencies. We cannot emphasise this enough,"" he said.\n\n> Mr Heng was speaking at the opening of the second Asia Tech x Singapore summit at The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore hotel in Marina Bay, organised by the Infocomm Media Development Authority.\n\n> He noted that crypto assets have gathered much interest due to their phenomenal growth and promises of high returns and, more recently, the crash of Terra Luna, which caused many investors to suffer heavy losses and triggered knock-on effects on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n> Nevertheless, Singapore will continue to adapt its rules to ensure that regulation remains facilitative of innovation, the minister said.\n\n> Mr Heng said crypto assets are part of a new wave of emerging digital technologies known loosely as Web 3.0 and the way to approach this is to keep an open mind.\n\n> ""We must pierce through both the hubris and the veil of suspicion to understand the potentially transformative underlying technologies,"" he said. ""Let us not throw out the baby with the bathwater.""\n\n> This is because the digital asset ecosystem comprises an entire range of services beyond cryptocurrency trading.\n\n> ""We remain keen to work with blockchain and digital asset players to encourage innovation, and build up trust in the sector,"" he added.\n\n> In the last two years, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has granted licences and in-principle approvals to 11 digital payment token service providers, including stablecoin players like Paxos, crypto exchanges like Coinhako and traditional financial institutions like DBS Vickers.\n\n> At the same time, MAS has consistently warned the public against trading in cryptocurrencies and took steps to limit promotion of cryptocurrencies to the general public earlier this year.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]

"Then let me make this very clear: You are more wrong than you're right.\n\nWe only occasionally see investors go against the market in general because they've done the math and realised things like the stock for a company is valued below the actually assets of the company, or that there will be a rush to buy stock as too many people have shortened it. Mostly most people only react to what other people are doing, or what they think that other people will be doing.\n\nIf for instance a company is reporting less growth than earlier the market drop in value will not represent only that less growth, instead it will be people reacting to what they think that other people will be doing. That's why you often see dips that quickly go deeper than where a stock stabilise perhaps just an hour later. Because people reacted to people, not to actual value.\n\nThere are no schemes or scams or whatever in that, it's just that people react to people, and people invest in other people's willingness to later on pay a different amount of monies for something. That's all there is."#### #### ####[]

"Uhhhhh what? ""You're never investing in anything, you're investing in hype"""". No dude, a lot of serious investments are done in actual assets/services/infrastructure and stuff that generates value. Of course, everything has a speculative component, but that's not the problem with crypto. The problem with crypto is that there is really no product at all, is just speculative practices of some sort of currencies. ""Yeah, so what, same happens with traditional currency market"", true, but all those currencies are regulated and they have whatever government works in that country. For cryptos you don't have regulation, let alone any sort of government power backing up such currency. Since with cryptos there's absolutely nothing behind, but people's hype, is safe to say that those are just ponzi schemes."#### #### ####[]

As long as I’m doing my own due diligence and trusting myself, then I believe I’m taking a calculated and well-managed risk."#### #### ####[]

USDC has regular audits by 3rd party and has BlackRock investing in it.\n\n**To lump UST with all other stables including USDC is what I am trying to dispel.**\n\nOf cos if you like others assume that I am a crypto degen and hate fiat, so be it.\n\nEDIT: On bank runs, I literally just wrote something 2hrs ago to support banks' resilience against bank runs.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v1nrm2/comment/ianiisq](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v1nrm2/comment/ianiisq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)"#### #### ####[]

"Reality is essentially a shared delusion where enough people have reached a not too intolerable state of status quo; and within that you will always find spheres of people with shared ideas that they erroneously think would work even at larger scales.\n\nOne such ""delusion"" (or rather illusion) is the objective value of certain things, as discussed in this comment thread.\n\nWithin a stable market you could for instance trade gold as if it has an objective value. But that value comes from people being willing to buy it, so it really just has a subjective value. If you were to get stuck with your gold in a bomb shelter without food or water you'd quickly learn that there's no objective value in gold, because it's practically worthless without people wanting to buy it. (Enough gold bars and it would do a decent job of preventing radiation from nukes, though; so it does work as the super rich man's lead as a construction material in bomb shelters.)\n\nDeFi values sounds great on papper, because just like with my example about gold the DeFI thoughts are happening within a certain type of stable market. So DeFi works when and where DeFi works.\n\nBut look at what happened when the embargos started hitting Russian banks; crypto transfers started happening differently.\n\nAlso look at the amount of hacking and blackmail happening where crypto can be traced going to North Korea.\n\nCertain types of deregulation and decentralisation will at large enough scales simply favour the already rich and powerful, leaving the little person at a disadvantage that we don't have in a more restricted system."#### #### ####[]

"Thank you for reading and reasoning.\n\n**Rant about crypto:**\n\nI cannot stand crypto degens like very the next guy. And the whole idea that crypto is here to replace fiat totally is a pipedream.\n\nPaypal tried to replace payment and fund transfer using credit cards, but in the end, they went for a hybrid solution, supporting VISA, Mastercard and what have you.\n\nAnd for the past half year, I asked numerous times for these folks to explain how hodling and never selling make sense. Only to either be downvoted or given the usual reddit nonsensical replies.\n\nOnly recently someone actually shared about taking profits when it is possible. It's crazy how most of the folks on r/CryptoCurrency are either just trolling or delusional.\n\nThe mantra is ""If you don't sell, you don't make a lose"", to which I'm like ""If you don't sell, you also don't make a profit"".\n\nIt's like the numerous billionaire CEOs who have paper wealth. They cannot just sell all and be rich. But at the same time, if they don't sell into fiat, they cannot use their wealth.\n\nAnyway, u/INSYNC0, again, thanks for listening to reason and actually having a proper discourse here."#### #### ####[]
"It's always nice to actually have a discussion on a topic where we are usually met with heavy resistance.\n\nOn why they are advocating this ""hodling"" thing, what makes you think those people pushing this mentality in the initial stages, have not taken profit?\n\nThe whole idea i believe is to just hivemind their way through. With less sell volume = upward pressure on price. Same with ""buy the dip"" mentality. I wouldn't be surprised if the ones pushing these mentality are the ones happily taking profits."#### #### ####[]
"Yeah, at some point, I came to this conclusion as well, that they are just trying to get people to hodl so the price do not go down and in some cases like Luna/UST, even get people to be their exit liquidity\nReason why I'm against it is that it just does not make sense to never sell, referring to those who really want to hodl till crypto replace fiat altogether, cos then you still have to ""sell""when you use your coins to buy things.\n\nAnd if they advocate prudent taking profit, people will not get burnt so badly when prices go through seasonal cycles, and they won't just end up selling out to cut losses.\n\nSo it's ironic that the ""hodl to their grave"" mantra often creates the dumping that they try to prevent at the first place."#### #### ####[]

These people want faces and it's beginning to throw those faces of theirs.\n \nIt's a fad that's gonna implode eventually IMO."#### #### ####[]
"Light pollution if it's so bright. Otherwise, I feel it's a good use of technology."#### #### ####[]
"About time, dont see the point of such led lights. So bright, brighter than my future."#### #### ####[]
I wouldn’t mind them if there’s aren’t so many lined up along the entire road and if they aren’t brighter than the fucking sun#### #### ####[]
they cost like $180 for 2 regardless of the numbers of days. doubt it cost that much to manufacture. pure profit for the operators.#### #### ####[]
I think LED wreaths are fine but limit it ah. Don't line the entire fucking street with them. Maybe keep to like 6 or smth#### #### ####[]

Good. I really hated these#### #### ####[]
Wait a min.. So they only self-ban within their premises due to power surge issues. Meanwhile HDB void deck no need worry abt power surge issues?#### #### ####[]
Causing powering trips?! Must be using tonnes of power. Town council should charge for the electricity used for those who insist on having them in their relative’s wake#### #### ####[]
wTf hasn’t it been banned yet?!? Does TC actually need to approve this nonsense. It’s pollution no? Light pollution and completely wasting electricity. So much for going green is TC approves these things. Great that this is reusable. But you can have fake flowers without these LEd and it wil still be reusable right.#### #### ####[]
Glad they see the light#### #### ####[]
2-3 acceptable....but a whole row?#### #### ####[]
Right when i thought razor could stick their hands into the funeral business with their fancy RGB lightings#### #### ####[]

Now how do I tell my deceased kin that his/her final wish of having LED wreaths cannot be fulfilled? /s#### #### ####[]
"Tell that to the funeral at the void deck of my hdb, not only they are occupying the main pathway to the coffeeshop nearby, the wealths are also blocking the way if you want to skirt the perimeter of the funeral if you don't want to cut through the funeral."#### #### ####[]
I saw ppl do burning at the void deck. I also see ppl do burning next to a wall of the hdb. So fire hazard from those led light seem less dangerous#### #### ####[]
I wonder why they make them so bright? Can't they adjust to lower wattage.#### #### ####[]

Just ban these funerals at HDB void decks. Why are these fossils causing a nuisance after they've croaked?#### #### ####[]
good#### #### ####[]
Missed opportunity for repeat business.#### #### ####[]
Unfortunately the ban only applies to the funeral parlors’ premises. People will continue to install these eyesores at HDB void decks and along roads. \n\nPersonally I think LTA should look into banning LED wreaths on sidewalks since the ultra bright white lights can temporarily blind you if you encounter them while driving around a corner.#### #### ####[]
+1\n\nIt's such a low-SES tacky stunt which only poor people would think of as showy. Attend any recent funeral of a well-to-do family and they won't be found anywhere.#### #### ####[]

The ones near me don't have sound thankfully. But they are really bright and glaring. The funeral parlors spam them along a 30m stretch so anyone who wants to walk to any of the 4 blocks in that area would have to walk past it. It also creates a noticeable increase in brightness along the corridors for low floor flats. Lucky i can't see them through my window.#### #### ####[]

"It kind of is.\n\nThe father's side of the extended family is super toxic. When my grandmother on that side passed away, dad and all the siblings were taking wreaths from colleagues, vendors or business partners as dick measuring contests. On one hand, it was really sad to see a decent woman depart this world, but on the other hand I was so fucking relieved that I will never have an obligation to see them again during CNY."#### #### ####[]
"Funerals for the Chinese used to be done to show how respected the family was and the status of the deceased. The longer the wake, the better the casket, the more elaborate the hearse, the longer the procession, the intensity of the crying, the higher the number of wreaths, the stricter the mourning clothes, the ability to inform the local leaders who would then come down to pay their respects, the size of the tomb, etc., the more face the family would have."#### #### ####[]
"Historically it is. \nBecause superstitions and perceived taboo, no one wanna look into it.\n\nI was handling my close relative funeral matter when talking to the undertaker about grand funeral processions.

"> # Man fined S$1.16 million for subletting rented properties on AirBnB, HomeAway\n\n> SINGAPORE: A man was fined about S$1.16 million on Monday (May 30) for providing unauthorised short-term accommodation on platforms such as AirBnB and HomeAway.\n\n> Simon Chan Chai Wan, 57, leased 14 units and sublet them out for short-term accommodation. His girlfriend Zhao Jing, 43, was fined S$84,000 for aiding him.\n\n> The fine imposed on Chan is the largest amount that has been meted out for a person in Singapore for such offences, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said.\n\n> Chan and Zhao were both licensed real estate agents at the time, court documents showed. They were also the directors of two companies – HTM Solutions and HTM Management for certain periods between 2016 and 2018. Chan was also the former director of a company called SNS Infotech.\n\n> Court documents showed that Chan leased various private residences to provide short-term accommodation to both local and foreign guests through the three companies, according to court documents.\n\n> The 14 units were in areas such as River Valley Road, Orchard Road, Killiney Road, Robinson Road and Keppel Bay.\n\n> The transactions took place on various platforms, including AirBnB and HomeAway, which allow users to post listings for apartments or houses for short-term stays.\n\n> “(Chan) leased units for the purposes of subletting them out for short-term accommodation,” court documents said.\n\n> He also persuaded Zhao to enter into tenancy agreements with the owners of two of the units.\n\n> Throughout the tenancy period, Chan and Zhao did not inform the owners of the units that they were being sublet out for short-term accommodation. They knew that doing so was illegal, court documents showed.\n\n> Besides helping Chan rent two units as part of the scheme, Zhao also helped him to set up and manage host accounts on the AirBnB platform and to post listings for the units.\n\n> She registered the first host account on AirBnB sometime in 2016 under the name “Jing”, where she listed several units. She also managed guest reservations, answered enquiries and updated the calendar.\n\n> ""Without Zhao’s assistance, Chan would not have been able to carry out the STA operation. Chan took care of matters outside of the accounts, that is, the day-to-day running of the units,"" court documents said.\n\n> Investigations showed that Chan had illegally provided short-term accommodation at 14 premises from Jun 30, 2017 to July 2018. The total revenue that he obtained was S$1,254,907.78.\n\n> Zhao was paid S$4,000 monthly for helping him in the scheme. Between Jun 30, 2017 and Aug 3, 2018, she received an income of about S$52,000.\n\n> Chan pleaded guilty to nine charges under the Planning Act, with another five taken into consideration for sentencing.\n\n> Under URA's regulations, all private residential properties rented out for accommodation purposes are subject to a minimum stay duration of three consecutive months.\n\n> ""Property owners should also exercise due diligence to ensure that their properties are not used by their tenants for unauthorised purposes,"" said URA.\n\n> ""Unauthorised short-term accommodation with frequent turnover of transient guests not only changes the residential character of a property, but also causes dis-amenities to neighbouring residents.\n\n> ""URA will continue to take strong enforcement actions against short-term accommodation offenders, including property owners, tenants, agents and anyone found to have assisted in such illicit activities, in order to safeguard the interest of the community.""\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[]
His mistake was not owning the properties. URA barely takes enforcement actions if you own the property you list on Airbnb.#### #### ####[]
"""URA will continue to take strong enforcement actions against short-term accommodation offenders, including property owners, tenants, agents and anyone found to have assisted in such illicit activities, in order to safeguard the interest of the community.""\n\nAhh yes strong actions. Hard to believe URA even cares with hundreds of listings on AirBnB where the addresses of all offending properties are literally listed lmao."#### #### ####[]
Nice !#### #### ####[]
This got to be the most expensive fine in Singapore..#### #### ####[]
"Frankly, if URA seized the properties and auctioned them on the open market as punishment on top of the fines, I think all the AirBnB listings will disappear.\n\nToo bad if the man is not the owner - the owners can sue the agent for losses.\n\nBut better not give them ideas..."#### #### ####[]
No sympathies whatsoever. I hope they deport his gf.#### #### ####[]
"his fine is 1.16M, profit is 1.25M. nett is 90k. \n\nhis girlfriend earned 52k. got fined 84k. nett is -32k. \n\nbesides the fact that the gf was paid a measly 4k to maintain all those properties, looks like Simon scammed his gf AND the landlords."#### #### ####[]
So he’s solving a market problem and gets punished for it? Aren’t JustCo doing the same thing by renting then subletting?#### #### ####[]
Curious to know why did Cisco officer went to a private apartment and check who’s living there? There needs to be some defined parameters.#### #### ####[]
No jail time or punitive measures they can just declare bankruptcy and not pay#### #### ####[]
Earn 1.2+ mil but only fined 1.16mil? Shouldn't it be at least double that? Plus iras needs to take action on him not declaring income...#### #### ####[]
"Where are the fines for AirBnB and Homeaway, since they made money too?"#### #### ####[]
How long is the jail term if he doesn’t want to pay the fine#### #### ####[]
serial killer: *sits far far away*#### #### ####[]
Not even monopoly allows sublets.#### #### ####[]
Chance card: Go directly to jail#### #### ####[]
But the cronies are playing it too#### #### ####[]
"Revenue is not the same thing as profit, his profit is likely to be lower than the fine after accounting for for things like the platform fees and upkeep of the properties."#### #### ####[]
Cost of business#### #### ####[]
He paid rent on those apartment as well#### #### ####[]
"Landlords, REITS, Kopitiam owners: 😎"#### #### ####[]
"Huh, really? Got a source?"#### #### ####[]
"URA isn't an enforcement agency, isn't it? It is a ""development authority."""#### #### ####[]
"Not all short-term accomodations are ilegal. URA has a set of regulations for it, and these two people being fined broke those regulations. For example, they leased property but did not inform the owner they were subletting.\n\nIt was implied they also broke minimum stay period that qualifies for short-term stay (3 months minimum), so these two were cycling people through at a faster rate than that. \n\nThis was likely how they got caught, because neighbors start seeing new faces coming and going. \n\nShort-term accomodation isn't ilegal."#### #### ####[]
If URA didn't care they wouldn't have fined this dude $1 mil#### #### ####[]
To an individual yes.#### #### ####[]
"If they deport some people for drinking beers during covid, then sure as hell wanna see these people get deported."#### #### ####[]
"That is not profit. 1.25m is revenue meaning haven’t minus off operations expense. He confirm in the negative if his rental payment is more the. 90k\n\nHe rented 14 apartment for 1year. Let’s say each apartment goes for 2.5k per month, total cost is 420k per year. Looks like he’s 330k in the negative for this crime."#### #### ####[]
Yea by creating a market problem and then offering a solution. Works everytime.#### #### ####[]
Obviously neighbours reported the multiple different people coming out of the same apartment every few weeks.#### #### ####[]
"Parameter 1: neighbour hear, see, report\n\nPar 2: neighbour see, report.\n\nPar 3: neighbours talk, report."#### #### ####[]
Revenue =/= profit#### #### ####[]
"Either you didn't read the article, or don't know what revenue means."#### #### ####[]
"That's true. You allow a stay of <3 months in my country to get booked, you get fined. Should be pretty trivial to automate.\n\nIf they can enforce GST on digital purchases, they can enforce this."#### #### ####[]
"Depends on the players. If a majority of the players let it slip then it may be possible to sublet in the game. \n\nWe played Monopoly ""by the book."" When I played with American friends, they made up rules as they went along, including subletting and ""protection fees."""#### #### ####[]
"Yea sure, but a fine at or greater than his derived revenue would be so much more punitive and discourage others from doing so"#### #### ####[]
This business going bankrupt#### #### ####[]
"The one I know, MCST complained to URA for 3 months before they came down, and all they did was post a warning to the unit that kena caught. 3 months later, Airbnbs were still streaming in. Another warning from URA. It only stopped when covid happened and the China owner lost the property due to repossession by the bank. URA are worthless, the only thing MCST can do is to turn away Airbnb guests if they are caught."#### #### ####[]
Is those kind of hush hush things that people know long ago but you’ll never see officials admitting. Similar to how speed camera will not catch you if you’re within 10km/h faster than speed limit.#### #### ####[]
Some government agencies have powers to issue fines and bring matters to court for areas under their purview.#### #### ####[]
I’ll sign a 50 years lease if I can find a condo that’s more than 50sqm for 2.5k @ district 10 haha.#### #### ####[]
if he was really in the negative he wouldn’t have done it in the first place.#### #### ####[]
And people wonder why Singaporeans are not entrepreneurial enough.#### #### ####[]
Yup. But doesn't mean the fine can't be based on revenue#### #### ####[]
I think he practice speed reading while still unable to read properly. Hahaha#### #### ####[]
Either you don't know what earn means or you just wanted to be snarky#### #### ####[]
He leased those 14 properties. When you account for the rent he paid he will be in the red about 500k if the rental was 3k/month for each property.#### #### ####[]
As would shooting people for drunk driving. Being punitive alone is not what any legal system attempts#### #### ####[]
TIL. Now I know what to do if I ever move out of my condo aha#### #### ####[]
Really??#### #### ####[]
2.5k is like 4 room HDB 10-15 min walk to MRT in Yishun. River Valley condo of the same size is gonna be what? at least 3 times that?#### #### ####[]
"Not D10, but my gf found one at D9 during the start of covid just before first CB and it was an awesome deal, walking distance to MRT, utilities included - below 2.5K. Basically a large 1LDK. Landlord was super awesome, and such a nice gentlemen that we wanted to treat him to dinner after the lease ended.\n\nHer lease cannot extend anymore at the start of this year, to no one's surprise."#### #### ####[]
?? Fine is based on revenue here#### #### ####[]
"No, you really don’t know what earn means.\n\nEarn (profit) = revenue - costs."#### #### ####[]
Should be at least 4-5k per property ba#### #### ####[]
Your condo more than 10km/h faster than speed limit?#### #### ####[]
Only for condo and landed can rent out on airbnb. Not bto hdbs though#### #### ####[]
"Not a 4-room. But I have friend that rented in one 2LDK condo near bideford, 1000sqft for $4K+. Another in Nassim same price. That was during covid though. Now the price is about 5-7k.\n\nThe best time to sign lease in a while was mid-2020 to 3Q2021."#### #### ####[]
"No, you really don't know what earn means. Net earnings in accounting terms is what you are referring to which is synonymous with profit. But in common English, earn can mean the money received, i.e. revenue."#### #### ####[]
"Actually officially is no for everybody. But they just kinda close one eye and if nobody complains then it’s all good. \n\nThen again, MCST might clamp down also so your mileage will vary.\n\nhttps://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/is-airbnb-illegal-singapore"#### #### ####[]

The NEA website says they are also starting to release at construction sites though, which might help to suppress dengue cases islandwide without the associated annoyance of male mosquitoes everywhere so I hope that works well."#### #### ####[]

"SINGAPORE - Recent National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) graduates will be able to head to Britain to look for jobs under a new visa designed to give British businesses access to graduates from the world's top universities. \nAccording to the British High Commission in Singapore, the United Kingdom's High Potential Individual (HPI) visa, which will be open to applicants from Monday (May 30), was introduced as part of a broader post-Brexit government strategy to make the country more globally competitive. \nThe scheme offers visas to people who completed a degree from top universities outside the UK within the last five years. \nNUS and NTU appear on the British Home Office's Top Global Universities list, which also includes Harvard, Stanford, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, Canada's University of Toronto, Peking University and Tsinghua University in China, and the University of Tokyo in Japan. \nInternational students in British universities are not included in the scheme, as they come under the UK graduate visa scheme, which allows those who have completed a degree within the UK to stay for at least two years after graduating. \nTo be included in the HPI visa list, the universities must have been placed in the Top 50 positions in at least two of the following world rankings: Times Higher Education World University Rankings, Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings and The Academic Ranking of World Universities by Shanghai Jiao Tong University. \nIn the latest Times Higher Education world ranking, NUS was placed 21st, while NTU was placed 46th. \nBesides having a bachelor's, master's, or a PhD from one of the universities on the list, applicants also have to meet English language requirements and have at least £1,270 (S$2,200) available in cash. \nApplicants need not have a job offer to qualify for the HPI visa. After arriving in the UK, visa holders with a bachelor's or master's degree will have two years to look for a job, while those with a PhD will be given three years to look for jobs. Visa holders can look for jobs in any industry. \nMr David Leong, who heads recruitment firm PeopleWorldwide Consulting, said that local graduates would find the visa scheme attractive, and added that it should be seen as ""brain gain"" in the long run rather than ""brain drain"". \n""It is good for young people to go out into the world and gain exposure and experience in vibrant economies. In some industries such as finance, there are many exciting opportunities in London."" \nHe said British firms will be keen on local graduates as they are well trained and have good work ethic. They also have skills, such as the ability to speak Mandarin and other Asian languages, which will give them an edge. \nHe added: ""I say it will be 'brain gain', because I do believe that after a few years, they are likely to come back home. I have seen this with many I have headhunted for jobs. They want to come back here once they are married and start a family, for practical reasons such as their children's education. And they come back with good experience and skills, including leadership skills."" \nRecent NUS law graduate Desmond Lee said he was likely to apply for the visa later this year. \n""I do corporate law and I am interested in going into fintech because I see many opportunities there. It will be great if I can go to London for a few months, network and look for a job there, instead of trying to do it from here. I could start with a temporary position, while I look for permanent opportunities,"" he said. \nNUS president Tan Eng Chye said he was heartened that NUS graduates are eligible for the new visa and called it a strong validation of the global competitiveness of NUS graduates. \nHe added: ""We will continue to champion interdisciplinary teaching and learning to nurture highly skilled, adaptable and resilient graduates who can make positive contributions as global citizens of the future."" \nNTU's deputy provost (education) Tan Ooi Kiang said NTU's inclusion in the scheme opens up a world of opportunities for its recent graduates to develop their employment and career prospects in the fifth-largest economy in the world. \nHe added: ""NTU graduates will be well placed to reap the benefits of this new scheme, having been exposed to various overseas offerings as part of the NTU experience, where our students get the opportunity to go on overseas internships and immersion programmes to expand their horizons and develop global perspectives."" \nBut Associate Professor Jason Tan from the National Institute of Education questioned the qualification criteria used for the visa, which leaves out graduates from other Singapore universities. \n""The students from the other local universities have similar, and in some disciplines, even better job outcomes. But because their universities do not appear in the top 50 list, they are left out. \n""There are many good universities in Singapore and around the world that will not do well in these rankings because they are not large, comprehensive universities with high research output, which is given significant weightage in these rankings."""#### #### ####[]

"Anyway, my original point is that the new scheme is for top universities around the world, so it's still a special opportunity only available to those smart enough to get into local U.\n\nAlso 20k is a fuckton to me. It's not about wealth, but more about valuing money differently."#### #### ####[]
Lol. Whatever I said still applies even if you are a broke student with zero income who thinks 20k extra is a fuckton. If you see this as a fuckton you have bigger issues than pure money. \n\nWhy? \n\n1) failure to look long term. Imagine choosing not to get an education because of 20k more especially in CS field where average starting salary > 5k + ability to work in UK that SIM-UOL confersZ \n\n2) somehow situation is so shitty that unable to get education loan in SG which actually doesn’t charge interest until you graduate and have low interest rates + very reasonable payment scheme. \n\n3) almost everything in SG cost waaaaaaay more than 20k. If 20k is a fuckton good luck to you ever buying a 3 room HDB or ever owning a car. \n\n20k for FWIW is literally not a lot of money in today’s context. As a young person you really need to set your sights higher and bigger and not lose the bigger picture.\n\nP.S. want to know what’s fuckton education cost? Go check private degrees in US and UK.#### #### ####[]
"Is that a fuck ton to you?\n\nSorry, let me correct myself, if it’s a fuck ton to you good luck buying a 500k HDB."#### #### ####[]
"Firstly, CS is 20k, other course might be even cheaper. \n\nStandard Entry BSc with exemption from 4 full units (8 units for 2 years)\nYear 2 : $11,150.00\nYear 3 : $9,950.00\nTotal course fee: $21,100.00 \n\nLook at NUS for comparison \n\nhttps://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/docs/info/administrative-policies-procedures/ugtuitioncurrent.pdf#page4\n\nSome SIM-UOL course might even be cheaper than NUS even after local subsidies. I myself paid 18k many years ago when I graduated from NTU on a 3 year degree program. If NUS I would have paid 26k. \n\nNext thing I’ll hear you say “omg 2k is fuck ton of money”, “omg 5k in favour of UNISIM is also fuck ton of money” \n\nClearly from the fact that you latched into the 20k raised by somebody else showed a clear lack of understanding of fees, got called out and then now try to hide behind “omg 20k is fuckton of money to me”.\n \nNice try. \n\nRegardless, I’ve adequately addressed why if you think 20k is fuckton you have bigger issues in your life, and I guess for you your bigger problem is resorting to taking the piss to save face. IIRC you’re also in the finance industry so spare me the “I value money differently” nonsense. If 20k is a fuckton to you then act like it and never ever buy a property that is 20x fuckton minimum in SG. \n\nP.S. UniSIM is not a top University in case you want to do another piss take. But they already had the opportunity long ago. Also SMU students are the one getting shafted here and they are local u…."#### #### ####[]

"Nah, Uber won't come back. Our market is too small & overly saturated with regional ride-serving services like Gojek, Lyft, & etc. Uber was designed to combat poor taxi services back in United States, but in Singapore, our taxi services are decent albeit with several black sheep."#### #### ####[]
you might want to check out this [docu done up by CNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJK-JsEqx0g&ab_channel=CNA) a few years ago on why Uber left. \n\n\nthis entire fare surge thing is not only happening in Singapore. it's apparently happening across south east Asia as well. my Malaysian colleagues were complaining about how their fares and delivery fees have increased for both food and transport to the point where I'm honestly too chicken to point out that I found it rather reasonable as a singaporean.#### #### ####[]
"Uber remains one of the largest shareholders in Grab. Makes no sense for it to throw money to compete with itself.\n\nThen again, there's Starhub, Singtel and Temasek but there's probably other considerations there."#### #### ####[]
Uber doesn't need to come back because they have a stake in grab. They have the benefit of not having to price war with grab while having the flexibility to exit/increase their exposure to the ride hailing business in SEA by selling or buying the stock.\n\nUber coming back would just mean both sides get less profitable and no way they would want to go back to that ..Uber themselves only recently just turn an operating profit in the end of 2021 and are hoping to sustain that.\n\nUber loss billions for more than a decade before turning a profit and grab would be in a similar boat .. Grab has even larger ambitions with their foray into Fintech and only time will tell if they would ever be successful with both their attempts..#### #### ####[]
They won't if you understand why they left the market *hint hint softbank *\n\nAlso there is a driver shortage and both uber and grabs game plan is to be so dominant in the market that they can raise prices and also have driver less cars#### #### ####[]
they signed a non compete clause with Grab after selling the SEA business to them#### #### ####[]
I'm afraid cheap taxi are gone for good.#### #### ####[]
I think should read into how Grab’s equity is made up of and why Uber left in the first place. And also how is Uber doing world wide and who or what their shareholders want.#### #### ####[]
I think both companies will struggle to make a profit and Uber in particular has run up massive debts which it will perhaps never be able to repay. Here is an interesting article which suggests the same https://doctorow.medium.com/the-big-lie-that-keeps-the-uber-bezzle-alive-8d6e8c0ccde7#### #### ####[]
"Uber themselves are also unprofitable with no guidance on when they can turn a net profit. Like Grab, their business model is also questionable and even more so if they come back and try to compete in this tiny saturated market.\n\nAlso will not solve the even bigger current problem: the lack of drivers. Many quit and changed jobs during the pandemic and they aren't coming back for various reasons. The money needs to be higher to get them back and all these surge incentives are still *not enough*.\n\nWith VC money drying up, it will be interesting where these poorly-designed businesses will go lol."#### #### ####[]
"I'm very confused by what people want.\n\nAt the current ""high prices"", they aren't profitable.\n\nSo the solution is to have more competition to get lower prices and they'll somehow make a profit?\n\nI do like how people will cry about grab being a loss-making machine and then demand low prices.\n\nThe good times weren't going to last."#### #### ####[]
Why would they? Unless they can pay out Softbank investment and do their own shit (which they can't)\n\nMarket conditions is the enemy now. No new entrant will alleviate the current situation. \n\nPetrol prices have nearly doubled while drivers earning remain flat. Will you continue to drive if it's you?#### #### ####[]
Uber already losing money#### #### ####[]
I'm seeing Uber and Uber Eats job postings in Singapore in the past week on LinkedIn. How strange! It is APAC focused so they might be coming back or perhaps having APAC HQ here to serve APAC markets outside of SEA.#### #### ####[]
"it's still cheap to take cab anywhere, can't say the same for grab due to surge pricing. maybe cos they are subsidising all the other currently unprofitable areas like grab-whatever. Uber already owns a big piece of grab anyway"#### #### ####[]
What's Uber going to do? Come back and lose even more money?#### #### ####[]
"Uber didn't leave, they own a 27.5% stake in Grab. They'll make money eventually and they don't need to do a single thing. \n\nThey can only come back if the sell most (or all) of their 27.5% stake. With Grab's stock price having plunged, they're not likely to do this anytime soon."#### #### ####[]
Is Lyft in singapore ?#### #### ####[]
\n>I do like how people will cry about grab being a loss-making machine and then demand low prices.\n\n... Who cries about grab being a loss making machine? The only people who care whether grab is profitable are the investors. I really don't think riders give a shit.#### #### ####[]
"An elegant matchmaking platform for drivers and users will remain at that, a low profit margin business. If grab dies (unlikely at this point since too much sunk cost), the concept stays and another will take its place where most of the takings to drivers and lower the price optimal level since there is no hefty middleman charges. \n\nTada still being around is a testimony to this model being somewhat sustainable to some extent. Whether the grab/uber model should command such high valuation while selling themselves as being profit super center by killing all other competitors through sheer capital dominance to become a monopoly is the sketchy aspect of Grab/Uber (Also softbank with its many investments). \n\nThere is a good reason why taxi services were all hyperlocal businesses in the past. Nothing about the economics of such business has changed. At its core, Grab/Uber introduced a terrific replacement to people flagging down cabs on the road and calling taxi call centres for advance bookings, nothing much more at this point. \n\nIn essence, what people want is for price to being more reasonable and drivers wants to maximize their takings. The solution? Minimize middleman cost to optimize supply and demand."#### #### ####[]
">So the solution is to have more competition to get lower prices and they'll somehow make a profit?\n\nostensibly with market competition, grab will have to reduce prices to get more customers, and then trim the fat in their HQ operations so as to become profitable. Means a lot of the expensive computer engineers, data scientists, marketing, sales, etc have to get cut."#### #### ####[]

"Even not factoring the travellator, it's also now a straight line between EWL and NEL, and the path is a lot wider than the old one.

"Most people leaving, said Pei, are headed to same place: Singapore. \n\n“Everyone’s going to Singapore,” said Pei, especially those working in finance, law and recruitment, she said.\n\nKay Kutt, CEO of the Hong-Kong based relocation company Silk Relo, agreed, saying people are attracted to the ease of business, family friendliness, tax incentives and open borders of Singapore.\n\nIn its 40-year existence, the past three years have been the busiest years on record for Silk Relo’s sister moving company, Asian Tigers, she said.\n\n“We cannot keep up with the capacity,” she said. “We don’t have enough people to serve what’s going on in the marketplace.” \n\nFamilies are transferring to Singapore, she said, but small- and medium-sized businesses are also on the move. Whereas one company executive might have left in the past, now “they’re all going,” she said. Small companies are “taking the entire team and putting them into Singapore.”\n\nLarge companies are also relocating to Singapore, said Cynthia Ang, an executive director at the recruitment firm Kerry Consulting. She cited L’Oreal, Moet Hennessy and VF Corporation — the latter which owns brands such as Timberland and North Face — as examples, while noting there are more who haven’t made their decisions public yet."#### #### ####[]

"I rejected a job offer (my 2nd choice) today, because I was holding out for my dream job to get back to me. And they did get back to me! It's a conditional job offer (some background checks to pass)! That of course generates some anxiety in me and the fear of failing it, so it's back to the waiting game for about 2 more weeks. \n\nAnyway, the HR from the place I rejected was so wholesome? I rejected because they had a special clearance thing which would take a while longer (which means I will have to reject all other offers in the meantime). She was like really understanding of my dilemma, told me to come back/apply for other open positions with them in case things didn't work out, wished me all the best, etc. The whole interaction was just so sincere and wholesome, I just really appreciated it haha."#### #### ####[]

I do wonder how is that possible? Did they take on multiple loans to make their life look ""normal""? \n\nI've been living with the principle of a zero debt approach i.e. clear all my dues timely, so i can't seem to wrap my head around this. \n\n\nI'm sorry if this should go to the financial advice section but i thought it'd be interesting to hear from everyone their thoughts."#### #### ####[]

I kind of regret choosing this course. After my first academic year I realised I don't quite enjoy what I study and my gpa has been really subpar.

At this rate I probably still can graduate in 3 years with minimally 1 internship but my gpa isn't going to be that great.#### #### ####[]

"Interview over!\n\nI think I did fairly well. :)\n\nHOWEVER, I wouldn't accept an offer from this place even if they offered me above the salary I expect. 😂 This was the interview with the company I was half-hearted about and considered cancelling last week. I was even hesitant at the point of application and held off on it overnight, but desperation prompted me. \n\nStill, I'm glad I went through with it and saw it through - at least it won't be a situation where I'm all ""danggit, I should have tried"". \n\nThe question now: do I inform them today that that I would like to withdraw from consideration, or do I wait a few days? The turnaround is two weeks. But the chances of me taking up a role with this place are next to none. More importantly, I don't wish to waste their time.\n\nAlso, I was offered another temp role before I left my home for the interview. That one ended up making me both happy and confused because it came at a time when I have ongoing interviews for perm jobs! 😅 But more on that later!"#### #### ####[]

"Don't worry about it. It is pretty common for this to be provided for in catering. By letting them know in advance, they can make the arrangements to ensure that you are served correctly during the wedding.\n\nJust that it will most likely be individual portions served for you while the others at thr table get the standard stuff, unless they have a sufficient amount of guests to form a full table of just vegetarians (assuming the 'normal' Chinese wedding banquet style)."#### #### ####[]
You are not. It's ok to ask.#### #### ####[]
I'm Not sure about now but years ago during my wedding. Vegetarians and those with restricted diets are grouped assigned on a table together ie 10 guests/table so their food is cooked and served separately. The problem arises when you get a number like 12 vegetarians or others because the dishes are prepped per table not per guest so you'll have 8 guests you need to fill in the table. Not really sure about it now after covid. Our wedding was 8 years ago#### #### ####[]

If it is 25 years, then no choice, you and your spouse have to continue this lifestyle while looking out for opportunities to improve your income AKA find a new job that pays better.\n\nIf you are taking way lesser than that for example 10 years, you probably want to ask yourselves, do you want to suffer 10 years just to pay finish something that you can pay in 25 years or you want to relax abit and enjoy a better standard of living for 25 years ."#### #### ####[]

Debt isn’t that bad as long as it’s incurred to acquire assets. Housing loan debt isn’t that bad but live within your means. Spending more than you have on your CC is bad. Getting a mortgage withdrawal loan on your house to invest in a stock market is risky but would pay rewards if you know what you’re doing#### #### ####[]

Uob ppv or hsbc revolution#### #### ####[]
"Depends on the stuff that you buy. I would pick hsbc revolution since I can earn up to 4 miles per dollar spend for dining, supermarket etc. UOB PPV for paywave transaction(using your mobile phone to pay, not physical card to earn up to 4 miles.) Citi reward card for online transaction and bill like SingTel ot StarHub.

Pretty sure the real solution to congestion is not just keep raising ERP rates#### #### ####[]
i remember reading somewhere that COE actually incentivizes congestion because its a sunk cost so people feel the need to use the car to get their moneys worth. to properly deal with congestion we should scrap COE and make ERP much higher instead so that u are focusing on taxing the usage of the car and not the ownership of it#### #### ####[]

"About a year. The relationship has become a bit toxic imo. She’s always the one that demands his attention at beck and call and is quite emotionally unstable (constant mood swings, clingy yet distant, too easily emotional over small things, takes offence over small things) He feels like his needs aren’t being met emotionally, and a lot of the time it’s about her.

as much as I don’t want to believe it but I seem to notice a pattern with someone I know. Own race are more prone to flaws….

"Oops, the person I'm talking about is of another race. Am only saying it anonymously on reddit and not in their face because it's quite sensitive. But anyway, I don't know if it's innate or perception brought upon by the eyes of society, but do you think brown people can be racist towards their own race? Doubt anyone would admit to it in this PC culture..so they tend to highlight the flaws of a brown person and be less forgiving than to someone fairer."#### #### ####[]

Doesn't bode well for future dealings with them once you start the job. \n\nI absolutely loathe this kind of employer who will delay and push back things when it's useful for them eg getting back to you about interview results but refuse to give one inch when it's the other way round.#### #### ####[]

And, of course, could be just immature and unwilling to grow right now.\n\nSince OP has gone out with the guy a few times and, despite this issue, is still on the fence about how to proceed, it seems worth the effort to at least find out a little more before making a final decision."#### #### ####[]

">(of a person or their judgement) not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts\n\nIs my example of objective standpoint not a fact?\n\nIn reality, there's no certainty.

"First, I can guarantee you it's not just dudes changing their behavior in an attempt to suit a crush's tastes.\n\nThe same line of reasoning can also be used to explain some behaviors carried over from past experience. Maybe this guy's previous partner may have dumped them for some reason that is now leading to the immature behavior. Like if guy is immature by throwing around cash, maybe it's because a past gf dumped him for not spending enough on her or being ""cheap"" and now he's worried it'll happen again with OP. Maybe the guy makes crass jokes because everyone always just ""laughs"" to avoid a conflict and nobody has talked to him about when they're appropriate yet.\n\nAs for your smoking example, I've seen compromise happen multiple times between romantic partners as well as friends. Some people just can't stand the strong smell, and are fine if the smoker does so only outdoors and cleans themselves up after. For others, it was more of a deal breaker and became the additional motivation the smoker needed to quit.\n\nNot everything is so black and white and not everyone is so set in their ways. Do you think people spontaneously change on their own? More often than not, there's an external spark. Typically a friend, a family member, a crush, something or someone causes a person to reflect on their thoughts or behaviors.\n\nIf there's no discussion, there's no chance. If there is a discussion, maybe it works, maybe it still falls though, but at least there's a chance for growth or at least understanding."#### #### ####[]

I think most teachers can tahan students being naughty unless they are incorrigible.\n\nWhat probably pisses them off is when:\n\n1. Parents off load everything to schools and teachers\n2. Parents choosing not to be partners in this and protecting their child 100% of the time even the the child is at fault here#### #### ####[]
"I grew up with hard love and a huge portion of my childhood involved violence. Looking back, I was the first child and my parents probably had no idea how to deal with a mischievous boy on top of other responsibilities in life.\n\nI turned out fine but I was never close to them.\n\nWhen my wife was expecting my girl. I started to worry. Despite knowing that I strived not to be like my parents, I also acknowledged the human tendency to choose the familiar. \n\nImplanted in my mind was this warped logic- If I turned out fine, therefore hard love and violence should be okay for my girl, it was also the only method I knew.\n\nSo started asking around and went for a course recommended by a friend. I honestly thought that being soft makes you weak but I told myself- Go learn something, if it fails, I can always go back to what I am good at.\n\nI learned that despite our good intentions, it was the way we speak/communicate that was crucial- how someone can perceive your good intention differently. I learned that approaching things empathetically helps lower defenses and alleviates anxiety. I learned the difference between being soft and firm. I learned that I can choose to be a father my girl feared, a father she will come when she only needs things or be a father that she can talk to. \n\nI observed that change is hard, the older participants in my course found it harder to adapt than the younger participants.\n\nI learned that knowing is not enough, it’s like learning a magic trick and there is a need to keep practising and reflecting. I practised on my nieces and colleagues.\n\nI learned that in our asian culture, we were taught to dismiss our feelings and it has effects on us- I observed that an angmo can go elaborate how fantastic their day was with a range of feeling descriptions. An Asian usually would say that their day was “So-So” or “Okay”. \n\nI noticed that the lesser time we spent with our children, the more tendency we will overcompensate to cover our guilt. The older generation may not understand that.\n\nI know there are many views out there. I just want to say that I still know how to treat someone with hard love and violence but I choose not to. I think it was a quote from Kindness Diary- “Although life may always contain both darkness and light, ultimately when we open our eyes to the world around us, it is our choice to decide how we see it.”\n\nYes, this world can be cruel and harsh. What are you expecting a child learn to be kinder by being cruel and harsh to them? Do we need to experience death to learn about death?\n \nI’m just throwing this out on the internet.\n\n_Now, hehe, back to my puns…_"#### #### ####[]
lmao valid argument - teachers are not getting respected.\n\ndumbass conclusion - teachers should be slapping students like the 1960s#### #### ####[]
That's because employers don't respect teachers. Expect them to suck up to students and parents. If get complain need to do a ton of paperwork explain left and right. Entity that employs teachers expect teachers to give in. With this kind of culture how do teachers get respect?#### #### ####[]
"Huh, teachers never slap students mean no discipline?\n\nIt seems the writer is the one that needs to be slapped."#### #### ####[]
"Writer deserves a slap for submitting such a worthless opinion. \n\nIn primary school, I vividly recall my male Chinese teacher making troublemakers stand at the front of class, holding up a stack of workbooks above our heads and hitting our arms or legs with a long wooden ruler when we misbehaved further or when our arms got weak. \n\nOn another occasion, my female Science teacher shouted at me to bring my textbook to the front of the class, pulled my ear, and flung my textbook out of the 5th floor window onto the grass field below, and sent me down to retrieve it back. Needless to say, I took my own sweet time and took detours before returning back. \n\nAnother silly time, my male Maths teacher snatched my long plastic ruler lying on my desk, smacked my palm so hard with it that it broke into two. He then gave me 10 dollars to go buy another replacement ruler during recess and return the change to him the next time I saw him. The entire class burst into laughter, including myself.\n\nDid most or any of these punishments make me respect (or fear) them? Absolutely not. \nIt just made me hate their lessons and lose interest in the subjects when they were in class. \nI wasn't even that rotten as a student, later taking on a number of monitor and prefect appointments throughout those years. \n\nLastly, would I want my children to go through what I went through? Absolutely fucking not."#### #### ####[]
"The example of slapping isn’t helpful to the argument. \nMy dad was pre-boomer, very traditional chinese educated. But my mum slapped me once and that was also the only time he disagreed in front of me with her she disciplined me. His reasoning? The slap may accidentally hit the ear and cause long lasting damage. Anyone who writes about slapping in discipline should not be taken seriously."#### #### ####[]
"He lost me at the beginning when he seem to support the idea that teachers could discipline students by any means necessary. Erm dude - did you mix up fear and respect? Can ST edit that away so at least people want to read the rest. Sian. Ok maybe the general idea is respect is good. I support that. We should all respect each other. And yes, some parents need to watch their tongue cos they do impart toxic thoughts to their kids. That is all I agree w. The rest about discipline. What does he want? Corporal punishment? Whipping and hitting?"#### #### ####[]
"What kind of sick fk is this who thinks it’s okay that teachers in the past used physical violence on other people’s children? \n\nAlso respect is earned, and truly capable teachers have ways of engaging such problematic kids to earn that respect. \n\nThis is the same backward thinking that just because someone is old AF that they deserve respect automatically even though they hadnt done anything to deserve it."#### #### ####[]
If the school system itself already doesn't treat teachers with respect how do you expect parents/students to suddenly do so#### #### ####[]
Sometimes I wonder if I'm living in the 80s/90s with articles like these every now and then from these fossils.#### #### ####[]
No. Like wtf? Singaporean parents are already expecting too much from their kids and the kids are already so stress out that more of them are suicidal/depress now than before. And you want the teachers to discipline them even more through physical means?\n\nGot detention not enough? Why need to slap?#### #### ####[]
"Aiyah don't need involve the children. Parents these day don't fear and respect teachers so let's extend the authority of teachers to include parents and give them power to dish out corporal punishment to parents.\n\nParents argue with teachers? That's a paddlin'. \n\nParents message teachers late at night and expect a prompt response? Paddlin'.\n\nParents offloading child rearing to teachers? Believe it or not, paddlin'."#### #### ####[]

"> # Letter of the week: Students and parents not showing teachers the respect they deserve\n\n> I remember my school days, when teachers could discipline students by any means necessary. I remember how students wouldn't even tell their parents when we got slapped, because our parents respected the fact that our teachers disciplined us.\n\n> We did not fear our teachers; we actually respected them. They made us the men and women we are today.\n\n> Sadly, I don't think this will apply to young people in the future, now that those disciplinary methods are no longer considered acceptable in class.\n\n> I have heard many stories from my teacher friends about students rolling their eyes at or shouting back at teachers, and being rude to them. I can't imagine this behaviour being tolerated by my teachers when I was in school.\n\n> Young people today learn from their parents, whether directly or indirectly, that it is all right to be disrespectful to their teachers.\n\n> They follow the examples of their parents, who talk to teachers and treat them as if they don't matter. I am appalled by the way parents treat teachers these days. Is this what Singapore has come to?\n\n> The authorities need to give teachers more protection. Parents should be warned that if they are disrespectful to teachers, they will be reprimanded.\n\n> If teachers are not protected, these incidents of students and their parents being rude to teachers will keep happening.

"... being rude to teachers? How about death threats? Anyone in teaching would tell you that the profession has become a customer service one where the parents and students expect the teacher to deliver the grades, even if the ""learner"" does the absolute minimum. The writer must be ancient to bring up slapping as a form of gaining respect..."#### #### ####[]
Even many teachers who think discipline is going to hell don't agree that slapping is the solution. That's just adding another problem (abusiveness) on top of the existing one.#### #### ####[]
Pls. Singaporeans generally don't show the respect#### #### ####[]
"Yeah, 2 is basically parents undoing whatever progress was made in school, when the child is at home. Then blaming the school for no progress."#### #### ####[]
"Used to do contract teaching in a Pri schl, and had my fair share of interactions. Theres two extreme ends: parents who are too hands on and expects the school to do this and that and questions every details; and parents who are entirely hands off. Either way both of these disproportionately expects the school to take care of their child's development instead of cooperating like partners. If there's nothing done at home, there's very little the school can do.\n\nIts quite sad that when I was still teaching, I discovered that a lot of processes in school were done in a particular way because ""parents will ask"" or ""we will have to answer to the parents""."#### #### ####[]
"Kudos to you for recognizing early what you need to be the kind of parent you want to be. And then working damn hard at applying what you’ve learned. Most have a general approach to things and just kinda wing it. Preparation (and training/practice) past baby caring is often unfortunately overlooked. \n\nYou go out there and be the best daddy you want to be, and yes don’t stop the punning, which coincidentally or not is also good preparation for all the dad jokes :)"#### #### ####[]
Be sure not to give them unjust pun-ishments and you'll be fine#### #### ####[]
What course is tt?#### #### ####[]
Someone ever once said parents are forever learning how to be parents. I think I see what he meant.#### #### ####[]
"I hate my father so much. I'm 28 (supporting myself) and he still is both verbally and physically abusive like calling me a fat pig, how im such a loser bc im single. He thinks that i have no single good qualities and say he scolds me is for my own good and if other people praise me they are being fake. I told myself i will beat him back when hes old, thats what allows me to keep living."#### #### ####[]
"This is really touching. Good for you for being brave enough to get help to learn more about your feelings and different parenting styles. That takes bravery, self-awareness, and wisdom."#### #### ####[]
Have a link to the course?#### #### ####[]
"That's Singapore service culture.\n\nIf bang table hard enough and/or shout loud enough, can get whatever you want.\n\nPeople are too scared of the aftermath."#### #### ####[]
I got slapped and beaten by p1-3 teachers bc i wanted to go to toilet urgently and they didnt let me. I mean i dont want to pee on the floor...#### #### ####[]
"My primary 4 Chinese teacher hated me and tormented me. She told my only friend not to be friends with me, ignore me when I tried to participate in class (raised my hand), insisted (when she arrived at the classroom) that she heard me talking between lessons and hence I must stand in the corridor for the whole lesson (on hindsight, to humiliate me as the other classes stream out for recess), made me sit all the way at the back of the class and basically ignored my existence, grabbed my shirt and pulled me back and forth like trying to punch me.\n\nThese didn't help my self esteem as my whole class was rich (good school, best class) and I was pretty damn poor. I rmb feeling so depressed. My guess is she bullied me because she knew my parents wouldn't stand up for me.\n\nI don't think the practices of teachers in the past are healthy are all."#### #### ####[]
"I feel that the writer assumes that the teacher is ALWAYS right, but that may not be the case.\n\nAn example: a teacher humiliated a retained student for asking question during the lesson, the retained student shouted back for saying he does not understand why is his question stupid. The teacher continued to berate the student, is he worth the respect then?\n\nAnother example which I vividly recalled of my pri 3/4 teacher making me copied the timetable 100x for forgetting to bring textbook/assessment book. My parents had to help me with drawing the boxes and I spent sleepless hours during the night doing it. It was just excessive and ridiculous. My parents being not so well educated also did not spoke out on my behalf.\n\nDwelling further into the past, I was slapped in primary 2 by a teacher for not even my fault, when a friend was making a lot of noise in the toilet. That teacher went in and slapped every girls in the toilet. I happened to open the cubicle door and was slapped too. Totally no link between slapping and respect, more like instilling fear in young kids.\n\nWho can stand on behalf of students if teachers abuse their power? For primary/sec school, the best the student can do is complain to the parents (for parents to judge whether to bring the matter up to the school)."#### #### ####[]

"Thanks for your kind words.\n\nI am blessed with a wonderful MIL caregiver which freed me time to reflect and discover ways to tackle issues along the way.\n\nMy heart goes out to those (my friends) who have more on their plate and are simply too tired to reflect or discover. I know they all want to give the best for their kids. Please wing it if you can, for your child. Even it do not turn out the way you want it to be, hey, you still made an effort to be a better parent!"#### #### ####[]
"It’s always for the laugh. Sadly at times, _no pun in 10 did_ work."#### #### ####[]
Some parents also should never be parents. They create lifelong trauma to their children and propagate the endless cycle of violence.#### #### ####[]
"_Before that, I was told, “You’ll never be ready to be a parent.”_"#### #### ####[]
"Hi, I hope you are feeling good today. :)\n\nI cannot help to agree that I felt this animosity towards my parents when I was younger. They kept saying that they are doing the best for me but their actions contradicted. I cannot help to feel despair, anger which resulted in hate. I wished I could choose my parents. I blamed my unhappy childhood on them. I felt like i could not cry for them during their funerals.\n\nIn retrospect, I was a child who did not get much help processing what was going on. I was left to deal with this all alone and was expected to grow up. \n\nThis child is still inside me, it comes out once a while whenever I see children who acted mischievously like me. I would be hostile/mean to these kids and try to make them change. Then I realised that I see them in me and was trying to “help myself”. It was pretty messed up. \n\nBro, you have the right to feel the way you are now. But what I am saying is you will be carrying this huge mess of unprocessed feelings and it will produce thought and manifest in actions. I have completely no idea how that will affect you.\n\nI am now on a journey to forgive my parents. The most liberating moment was sitting down and telling my mother the day which hurt me the most and what she did. There was silence. She confessed she totally had no recollection and apologised if it hurt me. For 30 years, I kept that shit in me and expected her to remember! I cried a little and hugged her. I was glad I was able to let go of that. The funny thing was- it was not about her apology, rather the changed was within me, the “liberation”. My mother didn’t change, I accepted that too.\n\nYou must be wondering why did I start doing this? Because there are people I love and all these are really affecting me. I just want to grow and let go of the mask and armour I had developed over the years to protect myself… when I was child left to my own device to fend for myself. It’s a good armour. But I can do without it.\n\nTake care! :)"#### #### ####[]
"I would argue that the extreme left and right are both sides of the same coin. Singaporeans want to feel good and masturbatory about going to school and learning about competition yet prefer to be conservative. But when push comes to shove, each and every incompetent ones will go down like a house of cards, which is extremely dangerous for the people around them and to a large extent society."#### #### ####[]
"Not all parents deserve children, but all children deserve parents."#### #### ####[]
"I wasn't mischievous as a kid. I was quiet and sedentary, I prefer reading books by myself. My parents were unhappy with me bc of things I couldn't change: my father preferred a son to carry on the family name, my parents wanted me to be a top scorer (I was good but not that smart), I couldn't get a scholarship. And even now they think about all my failures because they only like kids if the kid was successful. Now I don't want any kids or relationships (not that I have guys chasing after me anyway), because I don't want to bring kids into this world."#### #### ####[]

"Good on you for trying to help, but those food delivery apps take ~30% fee which is simply not sustainable for small stalls. There's also juggling with new devices, unfamiliar interfaces, adapting new processes, which she may be unwilling or unable to handle. If she's in a hawker centre, there's no way she's unaware of online alternatives, there's been such a massive push for digitalisation https://www.imda.gov.sg/hawkersgodigital \n\nWhat you can do is just publicise her business through word of mouth and social media food reviews. FB pages like Hawkers United have a good sized following and an audience ready to support good food."#### #### ####[]
"Well, start by creating a profile on Google maps, Facebook and leaving a good review."#### #### ####[]
"Speaking as a techie here: You probably can't get her to actively use a service.\n\nAlthough my experiences are with businesses in countries where you'd expect a much greater general tech competency I still run into the problem that if businesses aren't already using a good for them app/service/whatever you can't easily teach them to do so.\n\nIt is so easy to think that because it's obvious to you it will be obvious to them, and that you just have to show them what to do they'll instantly get it; but reality just isn't like that. And they will struggle.\n\nIf you want to help it will have to be you actively helping. Just like other people have said you need to post in existing groups, and if you set up social media profiles it will be you updating them.\n\nSo you need to have a think about what you actually can do here, because it will be your new job to handle social media for her."#### #### ####[]
Share name here la#### #### ####[]
"As someone who worked as a delivery rider and have talked to a couple of the hawkers, I'd say don't put her on the app.\n\nThey're gonna be charging a high commission and she won't be able to charge the higher markups as opposed to other hawkers who are already popular and with customers familiar with the name and willing to fork out more.\n\nI'd say, try to get her on Facebook groups and Instagram, set up those Google review pages for them, and just share her stall name via word of mouth. Try to collate orders for your colleagues and get food from there and see their reaction to it. Sometimes the tradition route also works."#### #### ####[]

"I'm headed to Maxwell today, will try to find and patronise her stall!"#### #### ####[]
What's her opening hours btw? Thinking I can try her food also#### #### ####[]
Maxwell has many stalls. Maybe her food doesn't stand out#### #### ####[]
Is it popo & nana?#### #### ####[]
What she selling first? Great food but what#### #### ####[]
remember back then this dishwasher told random stranger that she earned very little pay working at Sentosa#### #### ####[]
Just charge the food 30% higher on delivery app. The CBD folks can afford it.#### #### ####[]
">those food delivery apps take \~30% fee which is simply not sustainable for small stalls\n\nAnd people often forget that that's 30% out of the ""profit"" part of the sale. So if a plate of food would be 50% costs (groceries etc) and 50% towards their salary, then suddenly it's 50% to the regular costs, 30% to the service, and 20% to the salary.\n\nThat's 60% of their salary gone for every regular customer that try to support them by conveniently using their new digital service.\n\nIf they are currently at 100 customers for a certain period of time, they with the digital service now get 150 customers for the same period of time; with 25 regulars switching to using the new digital service that means:\n\nFirst their salary from regulars that show up and pay as usually drop to 75%.\n\nThen out of that other half of customers that use the digital service is 60% less; so that's 75 + (75 \* .4) = 105 total.\n\nSo that person is now making only 5% more money, but have to do 150% of the work that they used to do (which might be beyond what their small business can handle); and their costs are now actually higher because not only did they have to carry more (so maybe get something for that) but they also must have greater margins to cover great days vs bad day etc.\n\nAnd to top it all off these digital services sometimes withhold all money until the end of the next month before paying out, and they mercilessly remove any transactions that for some reason didn't go through.\n\nSo the business owner is doing 150% of their regular work for practically no extra profit, they take on a greater risk, and for up to two months they don't get any money at all for the digital sales. Aaaand since 50% of each plate is costs, and half the sales are digital they for these two months get zero salary for themselves. Aaaaaaaand if they are a digital success with more than 50% of the sales being digital it means that they personally would have to put cash into the business to cover the costs while they're getting no salary.\n\nSo even a success case would be no extra money, more risk, and without salary also practically running the business at a loss for two months."#### #### ####[]
There're also several facebook groups where you can post good hawker stalls for others to read about. I've found a few good eats that way.#### #### ####[]

"(Replying to myself here, because major edit otherwise.)\n\nI actually believe that there's a very good startup idea here.\n\nYou will always have these businesses that will essentially be outside of these technical support systems that are almost required today, and you will always have loyal customers that will want to do more to help.\n\nI think that a community service clearly run by those loyal customers could be a good thing.\n\nSo you have a community where a business is added, and that profile is similar to foursquare with mayors etc; and there you list things about that business. For instance you might list a service whereby someone ""manually"" go to a hawker to buy and deliver food to you. Or you list different social media profiles run by fans, and you get semi-official hashtags going so that the profile automatically include these posts. And you make sure to do good SEO for this profile.\n\nAnd you explain this to the business so you get official support and is allowed to put up a tag (NFC, QR, maybe BT-beacon) at that business.\n\n(I believe that this easily could be developed into a profitable startup, and even get government grants for supporting the community. It's not a business I'm in position to start and run, but I would love to in one way or another support such a project as a CTO or tech strategist etc.)\n\nEdit: Please add a comment if you're downvoting this, I would love the feedback."#### #### ####[]

"> Assuming you successfully help her register, if she has problems using those apps and calls you for help, will you be able to rush down from work to fix the problems?\n\nYes, better for OP to share about her food on his instagram or tiktok. Or bring his friends and colleagues to eat at the hawker. \n\nAlso check first if the hawker wants to sign up for food delivery apps. You can only encourage them to try.\n\nIf the food is really great can ask for food reviewers to try it. Although the unpaid genuine hawker food reviewers won't immediately try a recommended food stall. Either they happen to be in the area and remember your recommendation or multiple people have recommended the same food."#### #### ####[]
"How can I have her sign up that? \n\nShe would be doing it independently, I'll just be giving the initial push! Sometimes all you need is a push!\n\nI am just trying to get all the info for her so that she can understand what's the best plan for her. In the end its her decision, but I just wanna inform her that the online delivery system can also help her business"#### #### ####[]

42%. The companies take 30% of your revenue.\n\nSo an item that normally goes for $10 needs to be jacked up to $14.20 for the merchant to still earn $9.94 after the 30% cut.#### #### ####[]
"Pretty sure that it's actually 30% over the cost of food, not the profits. You can tell just by comparing prices between how much it costs to dine in vs to order delivery.\n\nUsually, restaurants just have different prices to cope with the extra fees that delivery services charge so works out in the end."#### #### ####[]

Did it! On the post!#### #### ####[]
what do you recommend from the stall? i'll give it a try the next time i go#### #### ####[]
"I would say butter chicken and chicken curry is very good and close to true indian taste. Love the vegeterian curries as well (Chickpea , potato's) they have sets also if you want to try as well!"#### #### ####[]
"hi i ate today. seems kinda pricey? 2 chapati, butter chicken, veg and chickpeas for $8.\n\ni think biz is bad for several reasons..\n\n\- maxwell is partially touristy? indian food at maxwell doesn't feature high on the agenda \n\- most of the indian/muslim food is centered at the far corner. lack of visibility. the row that this stall is at is quite dead \n\- from experience today, pricey? maxwell is quite competitive. you can have a decent meal for $4. for $8 you can have much better value at the Peranakan #01-80 Popo and Nana or #01-94 Ye Lai Xiang Tasty Barbecue\n\nin conclusion, i think going online would be good for her. gives her another source of business other than foot traffic. she isn't that old i think she can learn how to handle online orders and such."#### #### ####[]
"I'll disagree with the first line. Compared to other indian stalls/restaurant, its 50% cheaper and I believe the cheapest food there . Compared to other Maxwell stalls, it may look a little hefty on price, but then, you get that many variety as well. \nIts like comparing 2 different things, you cant compare price of steak dish to chicken rice. \n\nI am trying for an online push on her. Lets see if it is successful!"#### #### ####[]
agree to disagree. i don't eat indian food often so i don't have a benchmark. i'm more likely to go for indian rojak or mee goreng from the indian-muslim spectrum. \n\ni'm answering from the perspective of a frequent visitor to maxwell who doesn't have dietary restrictions or preferences.\n\ni guess the answer would be to widen her market. online is the way.#### #### ####[]
