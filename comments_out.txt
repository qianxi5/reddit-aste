"> # New ability tests expand pool of NSFs eligible for certain SAF roles\n\n> SINGAPORE - Lance Corporal Lau Kah Onn, 21, suffered from multiple kneecap dislocations in his teens while playing basketball in secondary school.\n\n> A history of injuries like his previously meant a blanket exemption from serving as a transport operator in national service, his current role at the Singapore Armed Forces' Transport Hub West.\n\n> But Lance Cpl Lau, who enlisted in May last year, is among a group of full-time national servicemen with certain limb conditions and past sports injuries who can now serve as transport operators.\n\n> This initiative is part of the SAF's push in recent years to deploy more soldiers in more meaningful roles, while maintaining safety and operational effectiveness.\n\n> This is being done by doing away with a binary mode of medically classifying soldiers into combat-fit and non-combat-fit, starting with transport operators in April last year.\n\n> To ensure the soldiers' safety and capacity to serve, trained SAF physiotherapists will evaluate the servicemen for their strength, range of motion and stability on a case-by-case basis.\n\n> This is done through ability tests - called functional assessment - that replicate the physical movements servicemen will need for specific roles, such as, in the case of transport operators, clambering on and off trucks.\n\n> The exercises used in the assessment for transport operators were developed by the Headquarters Army Medical Services, in consultation with physiotherapists and occupational therapists from Tan Tock Seng Hospital's National Driving Assessment and Rehabilitation Programme.\n\n> Upon passing the assessment, Lance Cpl Lau attended the same training as other transport operators who did not need the assessment and has been given the same duties.\n\n> He said he has no symptoms lingering from his injuries, other than the occasional stiffness, which does not affect his work.\n\n> The assessment helps optimise the deployment of every national serviceman by allowing servicemen of varying physical abilities to take on a wider range of operational roles.\n\n> Chief of Army Brigadier-General David Neo said in an interview last Wednesday (May 25) that the army will extend such functional assessments to other vocations and redesign new jobs.\n\n> This would translate into expanded deployment for 1,600 full-time national servicemen jobs across 89 vocations.\n\n> Since the assessment, which targets non-combat-fit servicemen with a Physical Employment Status (PES) of C and E, was introduced in April last year, SAF has increased its selection pool of potential transport operators by 7 per cent.\n\n> ""We are now able to look at the requirements of different jobs and say that it may be doable even though by the original PES system, you would not have been allowed to do so,"" said Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How, after visiting the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) School V at Kranji Camp II on Monday (May 30).\n\n> BMTC School V conducts basic military training for enlistees deemed non-combat-fit, such as Lance Cpl Lau.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([87, 88], [86], 'NEU'), ([25], [295, 296], 'NEU'), ([175], [295, 296], 'NEU'), ([400, 401], [295, 296], 'NEU'), ([25], [313], 'NEU'), ([175], [313], 'NEU'), ([25], [320], 'NEU'), ([173], [320], 'NEU'), ([175], [320], 'NEU'), ([400, 401], [320], 'NEU'), ([25], [343], 'NEU'), ([173], [343], 'NEU'), ([175], [343], 'NEU'), ([454, 457], [343], 'NEU'), ([25], [358], 'NEU'), ([175], [358], 'POS'), ([359], [358], 'POS'), ([454, 457], [358], 'NEU'), ([25], [394], 'NEU'), ([87, 88], [394], 'NEU'), ([173], [394], 'NEU'), ([175], [394], 'NEU'), ([400, 401], [394], 'NEU'), ([455, 457], [454], 'NEU'), ([175], [473], 'NEU')]

Details of the wedding, which took place in 2016, are not published as they could lead to identification of the parties involved.\n\n> The court heard that the victim and her husband have since divorced.\n\n> The offender, now in his 40s, was part of a group of groomsmen and bridesmaids who were invited to an after-party in the couple's bridal suite when the banquet ended.\n\n> Alcohol was available during the meal, and the group ordered and consumed more alcohol while in the suite.\n\n> Around 1am, the victim felt tired and left to shower and was alone in the bedroom while the group stayed in the living room.\n\n> The after-party ended at about 3am with everyone leaving except for the accused and victim's husband, who had fallen asleep in the living room.\n\n> Principal District Judge Victor Yeo said the main issues at trial were the facts of what had happened, and said that he believed the victim's testimony over the offender's.\n\n> VICTIM'S TESTIMONY\n\n> At trial, Deputy Public Prosecutors Ng Yiwen and Goh Yong Ngee argued that at about 6am, the victim woke up and felt she was being touched at her chest and private part.\n\n> She thought it was her husband and spoke to him, asking him to shower and sleep on the left side of the bed that she had left empty for him.\n\n> After each time she spoke, there was no response and the touching would momentarily stop before resuming.\n\n> The woman thought that the person might not be her husband as she felt the texture of jeans, which was not what he wore at the banquet.\n\n> However, she did not say anything as she did not think anyone besides her husband was in the bedroom with her.\n\n> After some time, she began to think that something was amiss and tried to look but the room was very dark and she could not see the person's face clearly.\n\n> The offender did not reply when she asked him to identify himself, and the victim became scared. Leaving the bedroom, she saw her husband in the living room and woke him up.\n\n> At that moment, the offender came out of the bedroom and started talking to the victim's husband. The victim saw that he was shirtless and wearing jeans.\n\n> She later confronted the offender and accused him of touching her.\n\n> The offender initially denied this, then later admitted to the victim's husband that he had touched her chest but not her private part.\n\n> The victim's husband told the offender to leave and the victim decided to make a police report.\n\n> OFFENDER'S TESTIMONY\n\n> Defence lawyers Edmond Pereira and Jessica Cheung argued that the offender believed he had woken up in his own bed at home.\n\n> He admitted to touching the victim's chest, saying that he had mistaken her for his wife. However, he denied sexually assaulting her.\n\n> The man claimed to have immediately retracted his hand when he heard the victim, which did not sound like his wife.\n\n> When he got out of bed and turned around, he said he was shocked to see that the person next to him was the victim.\n\n> He claimed that he went to the living room, where he woke the groom up and said he was sorry he had touched the victim's chest as he thought he was at home.\n\n> The man said he then left for home after he had put on his clothes and the groom told him he would settle the matter.\n\n> ""DESPERATE EXCUSE""\n\n> Judge Yeo said the offender's account of events was a ""desperate excuse"" conceived retroactively to explain his actions, and that his defence of mistaking the victim for his wife was ""unbelievable"".\n\n> If the offender believed he was at home, then he failed to explain why he deviated from his usual practice of sleeping on the floor instead of the bed if he had not showered, said the judge.\n\n> The offender's claim that the sounds he heard from the victim was also ""clearly a fabrication"" that differed from her evidence, said Judge Yeo.\n\n> Additionally, the man's behaviour with the groom in the living room after the incident was more consistent with guilt, and the offender was ""clearly trying to portray that he had owned up to his error immediately"".\n\n> In contrast, the victim was a credible and honest witness, whose account of events was ""unwavering"". It was also consistent and corroborated by evidence from her then husband, said Judge Yeo.\n\n> This made her evidence ""unusually convincing"", and meant the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt, said the judge.\n\n> The offender, who has a prior conviction for distributing uncensored films, will return to court for sentencing in July.\n\n> The punishment for sexually penetrating another person without consent is punishable with up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning.\n\n> The penalty for using criminal force to outrage a person's modesty is up to two years' jail, a fine, caning or any combination of these punishments.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([308], [84, 85], 'NEG'), ([727], [84, 85], 'NEG'), ([289], [150], 'NEU'), ([308], [150], 'NEU'), ([727], [150], 'NEU'), ([289], [161], 'NEU'), ([727], [161], 'NEU'), ([289], [212], 'NEG'), ([308], [212], 'NEG'), ([379], [212], 'NEG'), ([727], [212], 'NEG'), ([308], [311], 'NEG'), ([727], [311], 'NEG'), ([379], [382], 'NEG'), ([289], [465], 'NEU'), ([727], [465], 'NEU'), ([289], [582], 'NEU'), ([289], [739], 'NEU'), ([289], [762], 'NEU'), ([308], [762], 'NEU'), ([379], [762], 'NEU'), ([826], [762], 'NEU'), ([289], [788], 'NEU'), ([289], [790], 'NEU'), ([289], [824], 'NEU'), ([727], [824], 'NEU'), ([289], [862], 'NEU'), ([308], [862], 'NEU'), ([379], [862], 'NEU'), ([727], [862], 'NEU')]

Another news outlet reported that the couple dated for 11 years and divorced immediately after the incident. My guess is the groomsman managed to penetrate the bride. The husband probably found himself unable to continue the marriage after that.\n\nIt's a very tragic incident.#### #### ####[]

"> # 'If you do it your way, I slap you': Woman gets jail for repeatedly assaulting maid\n\n> SINGAPORE: A woman who was unhappy with the way her domestic worker did housework repeatedly assaulted the maid by slapping and hitting her.\n\n> Zhao Lin, 35, was on Monday (May 30) sentenced to five months' jail and a fine of S$1,000.\n\n> She pleaded guilty last month to four charges of voluntarily causing hurt and one count of mischief for damaging a phone that the victim bought to contact her family.\n\n> Another four charges were considered for sentencing.\n\n> The court previously heard that the victim, a Myanmar national, started working for Zhao in February 2016. Zhao was her first employer.\n\n> The victim's job scope included taking care of Zhao's son, who was aged about four at the time.\n\n> Zhao started abusing the victim in 2017 by hitting her because her work or attitude was purportedly not satisfactory.\n\n> She also deducted S$100 to S$200 from her maid's S$500 salary each month for mistakes made at work, such as breaking crockery.\n\n> The victim accepted the salary deductions as she ""did not know what would happen to her if she refused"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Teo Lu Jia.\n\n> WHAT HAPPENED\n\n> Zhao was working as a nurse at the time of the offences on Aug 25, 2018, which were captured by closed-circuit television cameras around the home.\n\n> The abuse started around midnight that day, when Zhao accused the victim of not keeping her son's toys properly.\n\n> Zhao told the victim, then 25, to ""stand properly"" and slapped her forcefully 10 times, loudly counting several of the slaps.\n\n> The victim did not retaliate. After slapping her, Zhao went on to sort her son's toys while saying: ""I will do it until you are really, really scared.""\n\n> The victim subsequently teared and cried quietly when she was alone.\n\n> In the morning, Zhao slapped the victim 10 times again as punishment for forgetting to wash some laundry.\n\n> A more sustained assault took place later that day, at about 4.30pm. The victim was cleaning the living room when Zhao suddenly asked her to stop and slapped her.\n\n> Zhao scolded the victim for the way she was vacuuming the floor and told her to ""use your eyes to see"".\n\n> Shortly after, Zhao slapped the victim again forcefully. The victim was shocked and spoke to the accused.\n\n> Zhao then shouted at the victim: ""Do it my way! What you're doing is your way! Everything I teach you, everything cannot remember!""\n\n> Zhao continued shouting at the victim, who replied again. Zhao got angry and hit the victim's arm and pulled her hair while shouting.\n\n> She swung her hand and hit the victim's cheek and arm, and kicked her twice at her upper thigh.\n\n> When the victim used her hands to block the blows, Zhao shouted, among other things: ""How dare you?!""\n\n> Zhao's son was in the living room during this assault and asked his mother why she was hitting the maid, to which she replied that the victim ""did wrong"" and ""hit mum"".\n\n> When Zhao stopped hitting her, the victim continued with housework while Zhao shouted various things, including: ""If you do it your way, I slap you. I will make sure you remember that, and my slap is always harder.""\n\n> About half an hour later, still unhappy with how the victim had done housework earlier, Zhao walked up to the victim and slapped her forcefully again.\n\n> The victim did not retaliate. For the next 15 minutes, Zhao continued scolding her about various issues.\n\n> She pulled the victim's hands, kicked the victim at her upper thigh and hit her arm repeatedly while scolding the woman for ""arguing"" with her.\n\n> At about 5.15pm, the victim called the police. She had not reported the assaults earlier as she was afraid of losing her job and feared Zhao, the court heard.\n\n> While the victim was making the police report, Zhao stared at her. When the call ended, Zhao immediately slapped the victim forcefully, hit her head, pulled her hair and kicked her while shouting.\n\n> When police arrived, they asked to view the CCTV footage but Zhao refused to show it to them.\n\n> Zhao's husband returned home later and informed the police officers that there were memory cards in the CCTV cameras. These were seized for investigations.\n\n> The victim was taken to the hospital, where she was found to have a contusion on her forehead and abrasions on various parts of her body.\n\n> Zhao also suffered bruises from the victim's efforts to defend herself against the assaults.\n\n> ""HUMILIATING"" ABUSE, SAYS PROSECUTION\n\n> The prosecution sought at least five to seven months' jail and a fine of about S$1,000, highlighting the victim's vulnerability as a migrant without a support network and in a subordinate position to her employer.\n\n> Ms Teo argued that the sustained abuse caused increasing psychological harm with each escalating incident, adding that the victim would cry and feel traumatised when she recounted what happened.\n\n> The nature of the abuse was also ""humiliating"", as it was calculated to bully the victim into submission, said the prosecutor.\n\n> Defence lawyer John Koh raised Zhao's post-natal depression in mitigation, although Ms Teo argued that this was found not to have a significant contributory link to Zhao's offences.\n\n> Zhao earlier made voluntary compensation of S$6,300 to the victim for the pain and suffering she experienced, her prospective earnings during unemployment and the damage to her phone.\n\n> The punishment for voluntarily causing hurt is jail for up to two years, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. Zhao was liable for an enhanced penalty of one-and-a-half times the maximum punishment as she committed the offences against a domestic worker.\n\n> The offence of mischief is punishable with jail for up to one year, a fine or both.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([149], [23], 'NEU'), ([224, 226], [23], 'NEU'), ([231], [23], 'NEU'), ([367], [23], 'NEU'), ([708, 709], [23], 'NEU'), ([733], [23], 'NEU'), ([788, 789], [23], 'NEU'), ([367], [121], 'NEU'), ([149], [304], 'NEU'), ([149], [388], 'NEU'), ([224, 226], [388], 'NEU'), ([543], [388], 'NEU'), ([708, 709], [388], 'NEU'), ([733], [388], 'NEU'), ([788, 789], [388], 'NEU'), ([119, 120], [553], 'NEU'), ([149], [553], 'NEU'), ([224, 226], [553], 'NEU'), ([231], [553], 'NEU'), ([367], [553], 'NEU'), ([708, 709], [553], 'NEU'), ([733], [553], 'NEU'), ([788, 789], [553], 'NEU'), ([890], [553], 'NEU'), ([149], [635], 'NEU'), ([367], [635], 'NEU'), ([708, 709], [635], 'NEU'), ([149], [782], 'NEU'), ([367], [782], 'NEU'), ([708, 709], [782], 'NEU'), ([149], [806], 'NEU'), ([367], [806], 'NEU'), ([149], [808], 'NEU'), ([367], [808], 'NEU'), ([708, 709], [808], 'NEU'), ([149], [821], 'NEU'), ([224, 226], [821], 'NEU'), ([367], [821], 'NEU'), ([708, 709], [821], 'NEU'), ([149], [950], 'NEU'), ([367], [950], 'NEU'), ([119, 120], [952], 'NEU'), ([149], [952], 'NEU'), ([224, 226], [952], 'NEU'), ([231], [952], 'NEU'), ([367], [952], 'NEU'), ([543], [952], 'NEU'), ([708, 709], [952], 'NEU'), ([733], [952], 'NEU'), ([788, 789], [952], 'NEU')]

"Wait till u see this..\n\n\nIn November 1990, Choo issued a false invoice from his company claiming to have sold equipment worth more than a million dollars to Wong See Kee, Choo's brother-in-law. Wong had used the invoice to get S$830,000 in financing, supposedly to pay for the purchase of the equipment. In 1999, Choo was charged with cheating. He resigned from his MP position and PAP before pleading guilty in court to a charge which was reduced from aggravated to simple cheating.\n\n\nChoo's former fellow MP and Senior Counsel, K Shanmugam, represented Choo. Shanmugam pushed for a fine instead of a jail sentence. Petition letters by grassroots leaders, vouching for Mr Choo's character, described Choo as ""hardworking,"" ""compassionate,"" ""selfless"" and dedicated to community service. Lee Hsien Loong, the then Acting Prime Minister, said that Choo has done the right thing in resigning as an MP and PAP member, before pleading guilty in court.\n\n\nChoo was sentenced to two weeks' jail and fined S$10,000.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) received several anonymous complaints against Choo alleging that he had charged his personal airfares, expenses, phone bills to STTA and received gifts from Chinese coaches and players. The total amount involved about S$10,600. The offences were allegedly committed during Choo's tenure as the president of the STTA.\n\nThe CPIB conducted investigations revealed that in 2005, Choo had received S$1,500 from Liu Zhongze, who was then a national team player, and Luo Jie, who was then an assistant coach of the STTA, in return for giving Liu more opportunities to represent the STTA in table tennis tournaments. Between 2003 and 2004, Choo is believed to have accepted USD$600 on two separate occasions from Shi Mei Sheng, who was then a STTA coach for approval of usage of two different training facilities in China.\n\n\nOn 8 December 2011, Choo was charged with three counts of corruption and one of criminal breach of trust. Koh Li Ping, former High Performance Manager of STTA, was also involved in the criminal breach of trust charge.\n\n\nThe CPIB said that between 2002 and 2003, Luo Jie, whose work pass only permitted him to work for STTA, provided table tennis training to students of Fuhua Secondary School. But the school was unable to pay him for the training provided, which amounted to S$8,400. Luo Jie told Choo and Koh about this, both of them then allegedly arranged with the school principal to engage STTA in a new training arrangement. The proceeds for the new training arrangement received will be used to pay Luo Jie for the outstanding fees. After STTA received the payment from the school, Koh obtained approval from Choo to authorise a payment of S$8,400 to Luo Jie, even though the latter did not provide any training services under the new training arrangement.\n\n\nChoo was acquitted of his charge of criminal breach of trust after the prosecution dropped the three other counts of corruption and proceeded with the criminal breach of trust charge\n\n\n\nhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/topic/cheating\n\n\nI see other cheating cases get sentenced way more than 2 weeks.\n\n\n> According to court documents, Tay was sentenced to 30 months' jail on Monday."#### #### ####[([297, 298], [10], 'NEU'), ([358, 360], [10], 'NEU'), ([458, 459], [10], 'NEU'), ([185, 186], [76], 'NEU'), ([297, 298], [76], 'NEU'), ([358, 360], [76], 'NEU'), ([185, 186], [255], 'NEU'), ([358, 360], [255], 'NEU'), ([185, 186], [296], 'NEU'), ([297, 298], [296], 'NEU'), ([458, 459], [296], 'NEU'), ([324], [323], 'POS'), ([185, 186], [406], 'NEU'), ([185, 186], [413], 'NEU'), ([297, 298], [413], 'NEU'), ([414, 415], [413], 'NEU'), ([297, 298], [426], 'NEU'), ([358, 360], [426], 'NEU'), ([458, 459], [454, 456], 'NEG'), ([458, 459], [455, 456], 'NEG'), ([297, 298], [462], 'NEU'), ([358, 360], [462], 'NEU'), ([458, 459], [462], 'NEU'), ([297, 298], [478], 'NEU')]

In this case, the victim had a video recording of their conversation which victim's friend's help record. And victim did say that he revealed his age which DK acknowledged. Very damning.\n\nMost people go to trial for serious cases despite overwhelming evidence so they can say to family and friends they are innocent. Save face. (The court was wrong, lawyer not good, police fixed them up, framed by victim) \n\nDK at his previous court appearance stated his intention to plead guilty but did not agree with DPP's Statement of Facts. So they sought an adjournment to agree on the SOF. The next day, DK attempted to carve out his own (misleading and sly) narrative and put out a video. That video was then removed. I suspect AG Chambers had a word with his lawyers and the deal on the number of charges preferred and to proceed might have to change as he was playing games. \n\nSo it was no surprise that the SOF was unusually lengthy and transparent for someone pleading guilty. Basically they could not trust him not to issue another misleading narrative. \n\nWorse still is the order for MOH examination to determine his paedophilic leanings if any. Which I don't think he expected. \n\nIn my view he was trying to save money and thought he could get away by providing ""alternative facts"" by pleading guilty. \n\nIn a nutshell he tried to game the system but it backfired."#### #### ####[([48], [250, 251], 'NEU'), ([254], [250, 251], 'NEU'), ([327], [250, 251], 'NEU'), ([48], [257], 'NEU'), ([254], [257], 'NEU'), ([327], [257], 'NEU'), ([48], [259], 'NEU'), ([254], [259], 'NEU'), ([327], [259], 'NEU'), ([48], [274], 'NEG'), ([327], [330], 'NEU')]

"Its a myth with some exception. People make those claims to appease their family members, friends and work colleagues.

"We don't have American-style plea deals in Singapore courts. We have the representations process. It's a negotiation between the accused and prosecution. One common approach is to set out mitigating factors and then say your client is prepared to take a certain course of action (i.e. plead guilty) if the charge is reduced/PP does not ask for custodian sentence. But none of these binds the court. The judge's sentencing powers are not fettered by what the prosecution asks for, though in practice the judge do take them into consideration.\n\nThe other issue is the accused must admit to a Statement of Facts. Any attempt to quality this admission or any sign that the accused believes the Statement of Facts is inaccurate will lead to rejection of the guilty plea. So if you go to PG and start saying shit like, I'm innocent, I didn't do this, or I did this but not that, but I have no choice but to plead guilty because blah blah, your guilty plea will not be accepted. \n\nDo people plead guilty even though they are innocent? I don't know. I think a better way to put that across is, do people plead guilty even though they *believe* they are innocent. To that question, I think the answer is yes. People are free to believe whatever they want."#### #### ####[]

"> # Total wage growth rebounded to 3.9% in 2021, but real growth in salaries dampened by higher inflation\n\n> SINGAPORE: Total wage growth rebounded to 3.9 per cent in 2021, comparable to before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, but real wage growth was dampened by higher inflation last year, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) said on Monday (May 30).\n\n> Real wage growth came in at 1.6 per cent in 2021 amid higher inflation last year. That figure is only slightly above the 1.4 per cent registered in 2020, and lower than the 3.3 per cent in 2019.\n\n> ""The strong recovery of Singapore’s economy and a tight labour market prompted more employers to raise their employees’ wages in 2021, following a period of wage moderation in 2020,"" said MOM.\n\n> ""As a result, more employees received wage increases last year, and wages also grew at a faster pace than in 2020.""\n\n> Total wage growth, including employer Central Provident Fund contributions, among resident employees who have been with the same employer for at least one year was 3.9 per cent in 2021 - the same as 2019. This is up from the 1.2 per cent recorded in 2020.\n\n> ""The rebound in total wage growth in 2021 reflects the broad-based economic recovery across industries, and a tight labour market due to border restrictions slowing down the inflow of non-resident labour,"" the ministry said.\n\n> After the global financial crisis, total wage growth rebounded the following year in 2010 to 5.7 per cent in the period of recovery.\n\n> While 2021's total wage growth also rebounded, it was lower than 2010, suggesting that employers may have been ""more cautious given the longer tail"" of the COVID-19 pandemic, said MOM.\n\n> ""As COVID-19 had a less severe impact on wages compared to the global financial crisis, wage growth also had less ground to recover in 2021 compared to 2010,"" added the ministry.\n\n> THREE IN FOUR EMPLOYERS PROFITABLE IN 2021\n\n> With Singapore's economy expanding by 7.6 per cent in 2021, the proportion of profitable employers increased from 63 per cent in 2020 to 75 per cent last year, enabling some employers to restore wage cuts made in 2020.\n\n> About 70 per cent of employees had wage increases in 2021, compared to 59 per cent in 2020, said MOM.\n\n> The extent of their wage increases was also higher in 2021 (6.3 per cent) than in 2020 (4.5 per cent). The proportion of employees that saw wage cuts in 2021 (10 per cent) was about half of 2020 (23 per cent).\n\n> Among employees who saw wage cuts in 2021, the wage cuts were less steep than in 2020.\n\n> SECTORS REGISTERED HIGHER TOTAL WAGE GROWTH\n\n> All sectors experienced higher total wage growth in 2021 compared to 2020, said MOM.\n\n> Outward-oriented sectors, in particular information and communications, financial and insurance services and manufacturing, registered healthy expansion even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to see ""strong wage growth"" in 2021, said MOM.\n\n> The information and communications sector saw total wage growth of 5.1 per cent, followed by the financial and insurance services at 4.1 per cent and manufacturing at 4 per cent.\n\n> Among domestic-oriented sectors, retail trade registered the highest wage increase at 5.5 per cent.\n\n> Sectors that were more affected by the pandemic also registered wage increases as demand for manpower rose in tandem with the reopening of borders, said MOM.\n\n> ""2021 saw a rebound in total wage growth, in tandem with the broad-based economic recovery,"" said MOM.\n\n> ""Real wage growth was dampened by rising inflation but remained positive and grew slightly faster compared to 2020.\n\n> ""In 2022, we expect the tight labour market to support continued nominal wage growth, although the significant relaxation of border restrictions will allow the non-resident workforce numbers to recover and ease some of the tightness.""\n\n> Downside risks to the global economy remain, such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and protracted global supply disruptions. MOM said this could moderate demand and nominal wage growth.\n\n> With recent shocks to the global supply chains, inflation is projected to stay elevated and dampen real wage growth this year, the ministry added.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([3, 4], [5], 'NEU'), ([14], [15], 'NEG'), ([21, 22], [23], 'NEU'), ([40, 41], [43], 'NEG'), ([212, 213], [43], 'NEU'), ([296, 297], [43], 'NEU'), ([614, 615], [43], 'NEU'), ([105, 106], [104], 'POS'), ([614, 615], [143], 'NEU'), ([212, 213], [211], 'NEG'), ([234, 235], [236], 'NEU'), ([381, 382], [236], 'NEU'), ([614, 615], [236], 'NEU'), ([105, 106], [260], 'NEG'), ([508, 509], [260], 'NEU'), ([614, 615], [260], 'NEU'), ([105, 106], [285, 286], 'NEG'), ([614, 615], [285, 286], 'NEU'), ([216, 217], [316], 'NEU'), ([508, 509], [316], 'NEU'), ([614, 615], [316], 'NEU'), ([508, 509], [332], 'NEU'), ([3, 4], [385], 'NEU'), ([14], [385], 'NEU'), ([21, 22], [385], 'NEU'), ([40, 41], [385], 'NEG'), ([105, 106], [385], 'NEU'), ([138], [385], 'NEU'), ([212, 213], [385], 'NEU'), ([216, 217], [385], 'NEU'), ([234, 235], [385], 'NEG'), ([296, 297], [385], 'NEU'), ([381, 382], [385], 'NEU'), ([601, 602], [385], 'NEG'), ([614, 615], [385], 'NEU'), ([3, 4], [430, 431], 'NEG'), ([14], [430, 431], 'NEG'), ([21, 22], [430, 431], 'NEG'), ([40, 41], [430, 431], 'NEG'), ([105, 106], [430, 431], 'NEG'), ([138], [430, 431], 'NEG'), ([212, 213], [430, 431], 'NEG'), ([234, 235], [430, 431], 'NEG'), ([296, 297], [430, 431], 'NEG'), ([601, 602], [430, 431], 'NEG'), ([614, 615], [430, 431], 'NEU'), ([105, 106], [437], 'NEU'), ([138], [437], 'NEU'), ([216, 217], [437], 'NEU'), ([296, 297], [437], 'NEU'), ([614, 615], [437], 'NEU'), ([14], [444], 'NEU'), ([105, 106], [444], 'NEU'), ([138], [444], 'NEU'), ([212, 213], [444], 'NEU'), ([296, 297], [444], 'NEU'), ([614, 615], [444], 'NEU'), ([470], [469], 'POS'), ([3, 4], [563], 'NEU'), ([14], [563], 'NEU'), ([21, 22], [563], 'NEU'), ([40, 41], [563], 'NEU'), ([59, 60], [563], 'NEU'), ([105, 106], [563], 'NEU'), ([138], [563], 'NEU'), ([212, 213], [563], 'NEU'), ([216, 217], [563], 'NEU'), ([234, 235], [563], 'NEU'), ([254, 255], [563], 'NEU'), ([296, 297], [563], 'NEU'), ([381, 382], [563], 'NEU'), ([14], [587], 'NEU'), ([138], [587], 'NEU'), ([216, 217], [587], 'NEU'), ([508, 509], [587], 'NEU'), ([3, 4], [591], 'NEU'), ([14], [591], 'NEU'), ([21, 22], [591], 'NEU'), ([40, 41], [591], 'NEU'), ([59, 60], [591], 'NEU'), ([105, 106], [591], 'NEU'), ([138], [591], 'NEU'), ([212, 213], [591], 'NEU'), ([216, 217], [591], 'NEU'), ([234, 235], [591], 'NEU'), ([254, 255], [591], 'NEU'), ([296, 297], [591], 'NEU'), ([381, 382], [591], 'NEU'), ([508, 509], [591], 'NEU'), ([614, 615], [591], 'NEU'), ([601, 602], [600], 'NEG'), ([21, 22], [630], 'NEU'), ([105, 106], [630], 'NEU'), ([138], [630], 'NEU'), ([212, 213], [630], 'NEU'), ([216, 217], [630], 'NEU'), ([296, 297], [630], 'NEU'), ([381, 382], [630], 'NEU'), ([508, 509], [630], 'NEU'), ([614, 615], [630], 'NEU'), ([105, 106], [631], 'NEU'), ([138], [631], 'NEU'), ([216, 217], [631], 'NEU')]

"> # The Big Read: Generational gap — a bridge too far or are we making too much of it?\n\n> Dr Mathew Mathews, a principal research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), acknowledged that the difference between generations is certainly real but there are many areas where aspirations are similar.\n\n> Pointing to results from the World Values Survey conducted by the IPS and released last year, Dr Mathews said the difference in opinion between generations here is actually “fairly small”.\n\n> “For instance, there are many priorities that all of us, regardless of age group, tend to embrace — we all have similar views about the importance of the family and the need to respect our elders.\n\n> “Both young and old in Singapore also take great pride in our country and its institutions — we recognise the social values that have helped steer the nation,” he said.\n\n> Agreeing, Asst Prof Ang said on climate change, for instance, Singaporeans across generations recognise it as a real problem that needs to be addressed, rather than it being a hoax or a conspiracy.\n\n> And on LGBTQ issues, most across the generations will probably agree that LGBTQ individuals should not be discriminated against.\n\n> “These are important commonalities that we should not downplay, especially in a society where different generations have come of age in vastly different environments,” he added.\n\n> HOW TO BRIDGE THE GAP\n\n> Rather than adopting the divisive practice of stereotyping each generation, individuals can instead focus on the commonalities that they share in order to bridge the gap, said the experts.\n\n> Asst Prof Ang said: “Older cohorts need to fight against the tendency to infantilise younger cohorts, while younger cohorts need to fight against the tendency to demonise older cohorts.”\n\n> To facilitate this, opportunities to allow meaningful cross-generational interactions must be created — whether in school, the workplace or at home, and also beyond these spaces.\n\n> Integrating more adult learners into university classrooms, for instance, can provide a safe space for engagement across generations, he added.\n\n> The NYC poll also highlighted how workplace and community initiatives could be useful in addressing the generational divide and dialogues could help bring different generations together to appreciate each other’s lived experiences.\n\n> So how should individuals seek to bridge the gap?\n\n> Ms Theresa Pong, the counselling director of The Relationship Room, which work with couples and families, said it is important to firstly, remain curious about why people may have differing views and secondly, to be respectful when addressing those views.\n\n> “When you are curious, you will seek the rationale for why people do things because there must be a reason. That’s when the wall can be lowered and true communication can happen.\n\n> “And when you can respect each other’s views, there is this thing called safety in communication. That’s when we know that when we share our views, it won’t be put down or be used against us,” she added.\n\n> Mr John Shepherd Lim, the chief well-being officer of Singapore Counselling Centre, said while it is not practical to expect all perspectives to be fully aligned and individuals to be fully agreeable at all times, there is a need to be mindful of extreme thinking or the “my way or the highway” stance.\n\n> Individuals should also avoid “black or white thinking”, or looking at issues in a straightforward manner, he added.\n\n> “At times we need to layer our perspectives. And we need to understand the context of each party’s viewpoints,"" he said. ""Because once we understand the context and we know where the (other) person is coming from, it is a lot easier to understand, and a lot easier to perhaps negotiate a certain stance.”\n\n> He added that apart from deciding what can be negotiated, it is also helpful for both parties to talk about the issue when they are in better control emotionally.\n\n> Speaking from her own experience, Ms Tan, the actress, said that when it comes to bridging the mother-daughter gap, she sticks to the mantra of ""never sweat the small stuff"".\n\n> “I don’t care what she wears, how she puts her makeup on or how late she stays up at night. I don’t sweat the small stuff. But we talk about the big stuff — our values in life, what’s right and what’s wrong ... we talk about education and work ethics,"" she said.\n\n> For Mr Fairul, the freelance performer, the unending support from the older folks within his family, especially his mother, has given him the confidence to have open conversations about the challenges he faces.\n\n> He said: “She’s very present in my life. She keeps herself up to date with what I’m doing, and she also makes the effort to be friends with my friends. It’s because of her I feel supported and can do the things that I want to do.”\n\n> This article was written in partnership with the National Youth Council and was originally published in TODAY.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([9], [10, 11], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], [103], 'NEU'), ([7], [103], 'NEU'), ([9], [103], 'NEU'), ([99], [103], 'NEU'), ([247], [103], 'NEU'), ([297], [103], 'NEU'), ([439], [103], 'NEU'), ([583], [103], 'NEU'), ([680], [103], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], [295], 'NEU'), ([297], [295], 'NEU'), ([439], [295], 'NEU'), ([583], [295], 'NEU'), ([680], [316], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], [327], 'NEU'), ([328], [327], 'POS'), ([439], [327], 'NEU'), ([583], [327], 'NEU'), ([680], [327], 'NEU'), ([439], [339], 'NEU'), ([680], [339], 'NEU'), ([439], [347], 'NEU'), ([680], [347], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], [405], 'NEU'), ([247], [405], 'NEU'), ([297], [405], 'NEU'), ([406], [405], 'NEU'), ([583], [405], 'NEU'), ([680], [405], 'NEU'), ([439], [442], 'NEG'), ([680], [461], 'NEU'), ([247], [502, 503], 'NEU'), ([583], [502, 503], 'NEU'), ([680], [502, 503], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], [516, 517], 'NEU'), ([247], [516, 517], 'NEU'), ([439], [516, 517], 'NEU'), ([583], [516, 517], 'NEU'), ([680], [516, 517], 'NEU'), ([680], [529], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], [598], 'NEU'), ([9], [598], 'NEU'), ([247], [598], 'NEU'), ([297], [598], 'NEU'), ([328], [598], 'NEU'), ([330], [598], 'NEU'), ([406], [598], 'NEU'), ([439], [598], 'NEU'), ([507], [598], 'NEU'), ([583], [598], 'NEU'), ([680], [598], 'NEU'), ([731], [598], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], [604], 'NEU'), ([9], [604], 'NEU'), ([247], [604], 'NEU'), ([297], [604], 'NEU'), ([328], [604], 'NEU'), ([330], [604], 'NEU'), ([439], [604], 'NEU'), ([680], [604], 'NEU'), ([439], [730], 'NEG'), ([731], [730], 'NEG'), ([439], [753], 'NEG'), ([680], [753], 'NEU'), ([680], [792], 'NEU')]

"Fans are very useful. A ceiling fan at maximum speed consumes at most 100 Watts while an air conditioner uses 3000 Watts (3 kWh per hour) to cool the room and 500 Watts to maintain the temperature. This is because fans do not cool the air, but rather recirculate cooler air from the rest of the room to replace the film of warm 37 degrees Celcius air around your skin. \n\nIn terms of electricity consumption, fridges use the most electricity as it is run 24/7, consuming 200W or 1 kWh every 5 hours. If you have your TV on and you are not currently watching it, it is better to switch it off as all electronic devices convert their electrical energy to heat energy as their end product. \n\nTo save electricity cooling yourself given the increasing electricity tariffs, use more fans instead. Fans use far less energy than AC. Drink water to cool yourself, water has a high heat capacity. If you want to use the AC, turn on the fan so that the air is circulated and the AC spends minimal time at maximum power.\n\nAnother way to cool yourself more is to switch to a laptop or undervolt your computer. A desktop PC draws about 500 Watts and a laptop about 200 Watts. For those stuck with a desktop, you can switch off your discrete GPU when not gaming, or use Throttlestop to limit CPU clock rates. This can save almost 200 Watts of power and make the surrounding air less warm. \n\nFor those using laptops, use blu-tack/ felt pads/ small eraser and raise the back of the laptop so that the laptop can vent the hot air out towards the rear of the laptop rather than being trapped under the laptop and dispersing the heat. \n\nMobile users should refrain from charging while using the device as charging will be slower and more inefficient also due to increased temperature. Additional power use results in more wasted heat."#### #### ####[([5, 6], [135], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], [139], 'NEU'), ([140], [139], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], [145], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], [157], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], [311], 'NEG'), ([140], [311], 'NEG'), ([170], [311], 'NEU'), ([308], [311], 'NEG'), ([5, 6], [314], 'NEG'), ([140], [314], 'NEG'), ([170], [314], 'NEG'), ([308], [314], 'NEG'), ([321, 322], [314], 'NEG'), ([5, 6], [318], 'NEG')]

"Compensation is a function of the Market. Companies do have to deal with this. People wanting to quit jobs for more money is hardly news :)\n\nFlexibility is a function of your role and to some extent culture. Roles, where people don't need to be glued to their seats or need to work in a specific window, should be flexible in those aspects. Not being flexible doesn't buy an employer anything and is IMHO just dumb. That said, flexibility is a double-edged sword and can leave your job vulnerable to being exported unless it has a regulatory tether to Singapore.\n\nTraining is the more interesting one of these. I am of course talking about the kind of training that leads to a certification or even a formal degree from an appropriate accredited body/university ( not - watch this video on youtube ...). Some certifications are expensive. Some require a commitment of time. If a company is willing to sponsor an employee in terms of time and/or cost, that's a win for both sides, provided the employee works there in the long term.\n\nMany MNCs do sponsor their employees for such programs provided they have worked for a certain number of years, have performed well, and are willing to work for at least a fixed number of years after the certification/degree is done.\n\nQuestion is - is an employee willing to commit to the company for at least a minimum period if the company spends time/money on their certification? With a pro-rata clawback clause if they leave before that...\n\nSome good companies will use this as an opportunity to introduce such programs. But don't expect everyone to do it.

"SINGAPORE - The pandemic unleashed not only a virus but also a seismic ceding of control from employers to workers worldwide and in Singapore.\n\nAnd it is not letting up as local workers keep up their expectations of more flexibility, training and pay in their jobs, according to surveys out this year.\n\nConducted by firms ranging from talent recruiters Michael Page and Randstad, and human resource consultants Mercer and KellyOCG, to tech companies Cisco and UiPath, these reports all reflect a consistent finding: A majority of local workers intend to quit in the coming months if their demands are not met.\n\nExcept that their bosses, too, are mulling over leaving: 81 per cent of 67 senior executives say they plan to resign within these two years, citing poor work-life balance as one reason in KellyOCG's findings. That statistic is higher than 69 per cent in Asia and 72 per cent globally.\n\nKellyOCG managing director Peter Hamilton expects the trend to persist given the talent crunch. ""Our survey shows that globally, 37 per cent of employee expectations have changed since the pandemic.\n\n""They have higher expectations around work-life balance, flexible working, benefits, well-being support. This figure is higher in Singapore at 43 per cent.""\n\nCompared with the rest of the world, local employers are less prepared to deal with the new aspirations foisted on them. About 12 per cent of them, compared with 15 per cent globally, fared well in an aggregate score that grades firms on employee experience, agility such as in the use of contingent workers, factors including diversity, and adoption of technology.\n\n\nGet tips to grow your investments and career in weekly newsletter\nEnter your e-mail\n Sign up\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.\n\nOnly 21 per cent of local companies said they are engaging employees on flexible work arrangements versus 33 per cent globally, Mr Hamilton said.\n\nIn Mercer's study, 62 per cent of staff say not being able to work remotely or hybrid permanently is a deal breaker when considering whether to join or stay with an organisation.\n\nAbout 86 per cent of C-suite executives, on the other hand, fret over the impact of permanent hybrid and remote working on office bonding, while 60 per cent believe ""fundamentally, work gets done in an office, not remotely"", the report adds.\n\nAuditor Urvish Sawalani, 25, sees no reason for bosses to call workers back. ""We can wake up and start later, but as long as we get the job done, that's what matters.""\n\nHe added: ""I think the perks that emerged to support employees during Covid-19 will become the new norm."" He also noted that employers were ""trying very hard"" to woo talent, including giving handouts to new employees to buy equipment for working from home.\n\nStaff engagement and choice are recurring advice to employers in the reports.\n\nMr Ravin Jesuthasan, Mercer's global leader of transformation services, said: ""The companies that will win are the ones who make it as easy as possible for people to engage with their company and do their work.\n\n""It's not going to be the companies that say, 'I give you flexibility, but you have to be in the office four days a week and those four days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday'. It is not flexibility if it is not a choice.""\n\nMORE ON THIS TOPIC\nS'pore salary guide: Are you getting paid as well as your peers?\nThe Great Renegotiation: Five views on what's changing about work, and what's not\nChoice, however, is not on employers' side, said Associate Professor Tan Hwee Hoon of the Singapore Management University.\n\nUntil the labour market eases, ""employers are unlikely to dictate where employees work"", she added.\n\n""There is no going back to the five-day work week. Some folks are talking about a 10-month work year, pointing to the need to provide more flexibility rather than less. What is happening in the labour market now is a movement towards employee preferences.""\n\nDespite all that, plus supply chain bottlenecks and inflation, employers are ""cautiously optimistic"" in their outlook, said the Singapore National Employers Federation.\n\nThe employers' trade union is urging bosses to offer versatile work locations, hours and contracts to tap underused labour sources and adopt automation and technology such as robots.\n\n""Technology: If you do it well, you can literally reduce your headcount costs to a fraction of what it is today,"" said its executive director, Mr Sim Gim Guan.\n\nUltimately, workers and employers are on the same team, said Mr Jesuthasan. But unless a global recession sets off a ""reset"", leverage will continue to tilt ""towards the employee side, or maybe stay the same"", he said.\n\nMORE ON THIS TOPIC\nHow Singapore firms are ramping up employee perks in fight for talent\nWork/Life: Bosses have no choice, okay?!\nThe 280,000 local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that hire about 70 per cent of the workforce here are getting the brunt of the talent churn, said recruiters.\n\nMr Kurt Wee, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, said: ""There is a disconnect between what companies need and how the workforce wants to work.\n\n""I will caution everybody not to be overoptimistic because we are facing a globally volatile situation. Employers are facing substantial cost increases on all fronts and there is a bit of job hopping going on.""\n\nCompanies need to recover productivity after the past two difficult years while grappling with a shortage of blue-collar workers, he added.\n\nThe tightening on the import of foreign labour is hurting SMEs, said Mr Wee. ""If you look at the real cost of hiring, and the number of locals you have to hire to hire foreign manpower, it's really expensive.\n\n""A company could feel that the labour supply conditions do not justify doing business any more and decide not to continue.\n\n""Another scenario is businesses deciding to downsize, because if they cannot get labour, why scale?""\n\nMr Sim said: ""Everyone is still readjusting, but by May next year, I believe we should be able to find an equilibrium."""#### #### ####[([125, 126], [124], 'NEG'), ([584, 585], [124], 'NEG'), ([922, 924], [124], 'NEG'), ([584, 585], [136], 'NEU'), ([622], [136], 'NEU'), ([643, 645], [136], 'NEU'), ([698, 699], [136], 'NEU'), ([844, 845], [136], 'NEU'), ([879], [136], 'NEU'), ([898], [136], 'NEU'), ([922, 924], [136], 'NEU'), ([584, 585], [178], 'NEU'), ([622], [178], 'NEU'), ([643, 645], [178], 'NEU'), ([698, 699], [178], 'NEU'), ([844, 845], [178], 'NEU'), ([879], [178], 'NEU'), ([898], [178], 'NEU'), ([922, 924], [178], 'NEU'), ([622], [455, 456], 'NEU'), ([643, 645], [455, 456], 'NEU'), ([898], [455, 456], 'NEU'), ([622], [532, 533], 'NEG'), ([643, 645], [532, 533], 'NEU'), ([898], [532, 533], 'NEU'), ([922, 924], [532, 533], 'NEG'), ([622], [621], 'NEU'), ([898], [621], 'NEU'), ([922, 924], [621], 'NEU'), ([584, 585], [669], 'NEU'), ([898], [669], 'NEU'), ([922, 924], [669], 'NEU'), ([584, 585], [696], 'NEU'), ([622], [696], 'NEU'), ([698, 699], [696], 'NEU'), ([898], [696], 'NEU'), ([922, 924], [696], 'NEU'), ([622], [740], 'NEG'), ([898], [740], 'NEU'), ([584, 585], [887], 'NEG'), ([622], [887], 'NEG'), ([584, 585], [926, 927], 'NEG'), ([622], [926, 927], 'NEG'), ([643, 645], [926, 927], 'NEG'), ([922, 924], [926, 927], 'NEG')]

Paya Lebar Air Base\n\n> Two of Singapore's air bases - Changi East and Tengah - are being expanded to accommodate the assets of Paya Lebar Air Base, which will move in the 2030s.\n\n> The move will free up about 800ha of land for development, with Mr Lee saying that height restrictions on surrounding areas will also be lifted.\n\n> He said the area possesses heritage and greenery, as well as opportunities for new housing and amenities.\n\n> The Singapore Institute of Architects and the Singapore Institute of Planners are working on plans for the area, which will be displayed for public feedback in June when the Urban Redevelopment Authority exhibits its long-term plans, said Mr Lee.\n\n> In April, he said proposals for the area included creating a heritage district out of old airport buildings.\n\n> 2. Greater Southern Waterfront\n\n> With a coastline of about 30km, the Greater Southern Waterfront, stretching from Pasir Panjang to Marina East, requires a lot of work and planning, said Mr Lee.Freeing up land to develop the waterfront will require the relocation of facilities that are critical to Singapore, he said. These include the city hub and Pasir Panjang ports, which will be moved to Tuas Mega Port.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([33, 34], [38], 'NEU'), ([146, 147], [38], 'NEU'), ([222, 223], [38], 'NEU'), ([282, 283], [38], 'NEU'), ([146, 147], [79, 80], 'NEU'), ([235], [79, 80], 'NEU'), ([282, 283], [79, 80], 'NEU'), ([33, 34], [114], 'NEU'), ([235], [114], 'NEU'), ([282, 283], [114], 'NEU')]

"> # Robust pay rises in Singapore last year tempered by inflation\n\n> SINGAPORE - Most workers saw pay hikes last year, but rising prices meant that their gains were tempered.\n\n> With a large majority of companies raking in profits, 70 per cent of workers saw their pay packets expand, with resident workers who had stayed in their jobs for at least one year taking home an extra 3.9 per cent on average.\n\n> But inflation ate into their gains and their spending power increased by just 1.6 per cent - less than half of their nominal pay hikes.\n\n> Despite nominally bigger pay cheques, workers have fared worse only once over the past five years. That was in 2020, when real wage growth was 1.4 per cent despite prices dipping marginally.\n\n> Some 59 per cent of workers saw their nominal pay increase in 2020. The biggest hikes went to junior executives, who have become the most sought-after segment of the workforce.\n\n> Prospects appeared brighter last year as the economy expanded 7.6 per cent and three in four companies were profitable. But an inflation rate of 2.3 per cent diluted real gains for workers.\n\n> High prices are expected to persist for the rest of the year as lockdowns in China and the Ukraine war worsen supply bottlenecks, said Dr Hong Ru, assistant professor of banking and finance at Nanyang Business School.\n\n> “The key is how fast we can get out of this supply chain issue and to really increase productivity. If we can do this fast, we will be in a good position next year,” he said.\n\n> Inflation is expected to peak at 4 per cent between July and September before easing in late 2022.\n\n> Recruiter Michael Page, which reported that most firms were planning to give annual increments of 3 per cent this year, expects that bigger hikes would be made after September.\n\n> Its managing director, Mr Nilay Khandelwal, said: “This is when we would really know what exactly would be the AI (annual increment) and inflation rates. Generally speaking, Singapore AI is pretty much tied to the inflation rate to a large extent.”\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([23], [22], 'NEG'), ([80, 81], [82], 'NEU'), ([239, 241], [82], 'NEU'), ([239, 241], [99], 'NEU'), ([239, 241], [105], 'NEU'), ([23], [161], 'POS'), ([80, 81], [161], 'NEU'), ([239, 241], [161], 'NEU'), ([192], [191], 'POS'), ([80, 81], [232], 'NEU'), ([126], [232], 'NEU'), ([239, 241], [232], 'NEU'), ([346, 347], [232], 'NEU'), ([239, 241], [245], 'NEU'), ([80, 81], [258], 'NEU'), ([239, 241], [343], 'NEU')]

"> Why should taxpayers help subsidize your flat just because you want to pop out kids?\n\nBecause one of biggest reasons why people don’t want to have kids is because of costs, especially housing costs.

"> # Commentary: Why is there another dengue outbreak in Singapore despite all our efforts?\n\n> SINGAPORE: It never rains, but it pours. Just when COVID-19 cases in Singapore have fallen back to lower levels, we are experiencing yet another outbreak, this time of a more familiar foe – dengue.\n\n> The number of cases reported so far this year has already exceeded the whole of 2021 and is already climbing towards the levels in 2020 when Singapore saw its worst dengue outbreak.\n\n> Why is this happening despite efforts by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the public in mosquito control?\n\n> To borrow terms we’ve become familiar with over the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effective reproductive number – the number of people infected by the mosquitoes infected by one dengue carrier – needs to be kept below 1 to curb transmission. And that isn’t currently happening.\n\n> We know some circumstantial factors that may be responsible for the current outbreak. The recent warm weather is conducive to mosquito population growth. DENV3, the current dominant serotype behind the large majority of cases now, has not circulated at such levels before 2021.\n\n> But here are two broader factors we think are responsible for why outbreaks like the current one still persist: Ever lower population immunity and ever better diagnostics. Ironically, both are good problems to have.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([212, 213], [60], 'NEU'), ([212, 213], [211], 'NEU')]

"> # Forum: Make jobs that require physical labour more attractive to Singaporeans\n\n> I fully support Forum writer Chia Eu Foong's call to make cleaners' jobs more attractive (Make cleaner job more attractive, May 18) by giving better perks and conditions of service.\n\n> Jobs such as cleaning toilets and wiping tables at foodcourts and hawker centres, removing garbage from bin centres in HDB estates, repairing roads and working at construction sites are mostly done by foreign workers. The salaries paid are often low. Singaporeans shun these jobs.\n\n> These jobs are very important and essential to keep Singapore clean and the economy moving forward. For example, if garbage is not cleared from bin centres for even one day, the estates would stink.\n\n> Currently, there are many workers in other countries who are willing to work in Singapore because of the Singapore dollar's strength and the weaker economy in their own countries. But what if this were to one day change? As Singaporeans will not do these jobs, what would happen to the country then?\n\n> The present over-reliance on foreign workers to do these jobs is inadvisable. A good example is how Build-To-Order flats have been delayed due to the foreign labour crunch.\n\n> To entice Singaporeans to do these jobs, the salaries, perks, conditions of service and status have to be improved drastically, whether employers like it or not. Introduce more automation instead of merely relying on physical labour.\n\n> The authorities will have to look into this matter urgently to see how Singapore can be more self-reliant in labour.\n\n> Pavithran Vidyadharan\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([64, 65], [144], 'NEU'), ([64, 65], [184], 'NEU'), ([64, 65], [228], 'NEU'), ([229], [228], 'NEU'), ([64, 65], [254], 'NEU')]

In HK you’re flooded with offers. SG crickets. \nJapan and Australia, skilled trades have pretty high prestige. And that does translate from the more relatable „craft“ skills like carpentry to the more mundane like electrician and plumber. \n\nMy handyman makes good money - take home at a day is several hundreds he said, and getting his time is _hard_. But yeah, in terms of social prestige probably below an admin assistant for a local SME who makes half. \n\nIm pretty sure it’s not about the cost. If you replaced 500k Bangladeshi workers with Singaporeans who earn triple, you’d likely end up with only 150k Singaporeans who use all the fancy productivity enhancing tools to get the same work done three times faster. I remember a few year ago in Japan, all the workers I saw on site used battery power tools only. Those are 5-10x more expensive, but no more pulling wires, finding / competing for outlets etc.\n\nIf there is one insurmountable obstacle I can see to hiring locals it’s the heat. That really makes at least construction super undesirable."#### #### ####[]

"If you check the [URA master plan website](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps), you would have noticed a few past master plan available for viewing, such as the 2019, 2013, 2008 and 2003 ones. But the first of the Development Guide Plans which follows this modern style, the one for 1998, is missing. Perhaps an attempt to erase the mistakes of the past, which is a shame, for the 1998 plan is quite a bit more detailed than the 2003 one.\n\nAs it turns out, it is available for viewing on the [National Archives of Singapore website](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/). Here, you get the 1998 master plan in discontinuous sections. I went to stitch up certain portions of it covering the Simpang planning area, revealing a plan that is drastically different from that of even the [commonly shared napkin sketch online](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Simpang_New_Town_%28merged%29.png).\n\nIt is interesting to note that there are no signs of MRT or LRT systems in this map, which perhaps is meant to be planned afterwards for this town. The common plot ratios here for residential areas are 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.1 and 2.5, as opposed to the 2.8 in most HDB towns, with roads further from each other while narrower than plans nowadays, suggesting that this town would have been a lot less dense than usual if it had went ahead. Perhaps it would be a nice breather from the crowds we see nowadays. Notably, is also split into 2 sections with no connections between each other; a strange design choice for a supposed town.\n\nStill, many of the design principles here seemed to have since been incorporated into newer towns. For example, linear parks along the coastline and surrounding the modified Sungei Simpang, provides residents a means to run or cycle from the periphery of the town to the Simpang Town Centre marked in blue, which are features similar to My Waterway @ Punggol in Punggol New Town, or Forest Stream and Tengah Pond in Tengah New Town. A new reclaimed island at the northern tip of the town provides a nice seaview similar to the Northshore district of Punggol, except it is even better as people living on that island would have a 360° view of waters, which is not ruined as much by the Pasir Gudang Industrial Area in Johor.\n\nIt is sure a shame that this plan did not come into fruition, but it may also be a blessing given how much of a clusterf*ck Yishun has become. Simpang would have made the crowd there worse without additional rail connections. In 2 decades’ time, come the 9th MRT line, perhaps a new generation of urban planners will reimagine the design of the last new town in Singapore built out of forests. Or perhaps the forest will continue to be conserved as a military training ground, who knows."#### #### ####[([34, 36], [40], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [40], 'NEU'), ([162, 163], [40], 'NEU'), ([185], [40], 'NEU'), ([299], [40], 'NEU'), ([368, 371], [40], 'NEU'), ([185], [99], 'NEU'), ([368, 371], [99], 'NEU'), ([407], [99], 'NEU'), ([34, 36], [121], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [121], 'NEU'), ([185], [121], 'NEU'), ([250, 251], [121], 'NEU'), ([264, 265], [121], 'NEU'), ([299], [121], 'NEU'), ([311, 312], [121], 'NEU'), ([334], [121], 'NEU'), ([368, 371], [121], 'NEU'), ([380], [121], 'NEU'), ([407], [121], 'NEU'), ([34, 36], [191], 'NEU'), ([34, 36], [240], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [240], 'NEU'), ([162, 163], [240], 'NEU'), ([311, 312], [240], 'NEU'), ([334], [240], 'NEU'), ([368, 371], [240], 'NEU'), ([407], [240], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [272], 'NEU'), ([368, 371], [272], 'NEU'), ([34, 36], [300], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [300], 'NEU'), ([162, 163], [300], 'NEU'), ([185], [300], 'NEU'), ([299], [300], 'NEU'), ([368, 371], [300], 'NEU'), ([34, 36], [333], 'NEU'), ([162, 163], [333], 'POS'), ([334], [333], 'POS'), ([34, 36], [346], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [346], 'NEU'), ([162, 163], [346], 'NEU'), ([185], [346], 'NEU'), ([250, 251], [346], 'NEU'), ([264, 265], [346], 'NEU'), ([368, 371], [346], 'NEU'), ([448], [346], 'NEU'), ([34, 36], [362, 363], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [362, 363], 'NEU'), ([185], [362, 363], 'NEU'), ([34, 36], [363], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [363], 'NEU'), ([162, 163], [363], 'NEU'), ([185], [363], 'NEU'), ([299], [363], 'NEU'), ([368, 371], [363], 'NEU'), ([34, 36], [377], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [377], 'NEU'), ([162, 163], [377], 'NEU'), ([299], [377], 'NEU'), ([368, 371], [377], 'NEU'), ([34, 36], [392], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [392], 'NEU'), ([162, 163], [392], 'NEU'), ([185], [392], 'NEU'), ([250, 251], [392], 'NEU'), ([264, 265], [392], 'NEU'), ([299], [392], 'NEU'), ([311, 312], [392], 'NEU'), ([34, 36], [409], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [409], 'NEU'), ([162, 163], [409], 'NEG'), ([407], [409], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [431], 'NEU'), ([185], [431], 'NEU'), ([34, 36], [453], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [453], 'NEU'), ([185], [453], 'NEU'), ([299], [453], 'NEU'), ([334], [453], 'NEU'), ([368, 371], [453], 'NEU')]

They ranked 25th in the corruption index. A successful democracy must also have very little corruption. There are no lack of failing democracies due to corruptions. I'm not saying that Taiwan will become one. But it also does not look that any major shift will happen in the right direction soon.\n\nTo me, a successful democracy is Switzerland. Very little corruption, politics is important but not overwhelming, voters are politically savvy, multiparty system which avoids polarising the society, competent politicians gets elected etc."#### #### ####[([92], [23], 'NEG'), ([118], [23], 'NEG'), ([126], [23], 'NEG'), ([201, 202], [23], 'NEU'), ([73], [75, 78], 'NEG'), ([92], [75, 78], 'NEG'), ([92], [95, 98], 'NEG'), ([92], [98], 'NEG')]

"> # In bad taste? National Crime Prevention Council removes Amber Heard meme\n\n> SINGAPORE - The National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) has removed from its Facebook page a controversial meme featuring an image of Amber Heard from the defamation suit between the actress and her ex-husband, actor Johnny Depp.\n\n> The post, which was uploaded last Thursday (May 26) and shared 1,000 times before it was taken down on Monday night, uses a viral moment from Heard's testimony about Depp conducting a ""cavity search"" on her - sexually assaulting her with his fingers after accusing her of hiding his drugs.\n\n> While recounting what happened following the incident, Heard winces and says her dog stepped on a bee and had to be taken to a veterinarian.\n\n> The NCPC's meme used Heard's wincing face but replaced her line of ""My dog stepped on a bee"" with other one-liners that rhyme with ""bee"". Similar memes have been appeared on meme sites like SGAG, where one such TikTok video received over 16,800 likes.\n\n> The NCPC apologised for the post on Tuesday night. In a statement, it said: ""We had used the photo as we thought the expression captured how members of the public might react when they spot the various signs of scams. It was not our intention to demean or insult anyone. We apologise for the post and any offence caused, and will do better in our efforts to outreach to Singaporeans about scams.""\n\n> Gender advocacy group Aware warned that such jokes and memes about the Depp-Heard trial, regardless of its outcome, can harm survivors of domestic violence.\n\n> In response to ST queries, Ms Kelly Leow, senior communications manager at Aware, says the ""sheer ubiquity"" of social media content about the trial makes it ""practically impossible for survivors to go even one day without encountering such content online"".\n\n> She adds: ""Those who have experienced domestic violence themselves would likely be re-traumatised by witnessing scenes from the trial itself, in which acts of violence are detailed at length, and also by the outpouring of callous jokes surrounding the trial.""\n\n> Ms Rachel Lim, 29, a survivor of intimate partner abuse, has been ""troubled"" by the deluge of social media content about the defamation case.\n\n> ""The verdict is not even out yet and even if it was, this is in very bad taste,"" the content strategist says.\n\n> She adds: ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But when you share or create a meme you have to understand your own intentions - are you trying to create a more peaceful world or are you trying to direct hate towards somebody?""\n\n> Ms Leow adds that the way that this trial has been presented in the media and on social media tends to erase nuances, turning a complicated situation into a black-and-white, he versus she narrative.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([282, 284], [3], 'NEU'), ([282, 284], [22], 'NEU'), ([369], [22], 'NEU'), ([29], [28], 'NEG'), ([150], [28], 'NEU'), ([282, 284], [28], 'NEU'), ([29], [132], 'NEU'), ([240, 243], [132], 'NEU'), ([282, 284], [132], 'NEU'), ([361, 363], [132], 'NEU'), ([369], [132], 'NEU'), ([150], [149], 'NEU'), ([282, 284], [149], 'NEU'), ([369], [149], 'NEU'), ([369], [230], 'NEU'), ([282, 284], [291], 'NEU'), ([150], [330], 'NEU'), ([282, 284], [384], 'NEU'), ([29], [454], 'NEU'), ([150], [454], 'NEU'), ([282, 284], [454], 'NEU'), ([282, 284], [458], 'NEU')]

It did not specify what the grounds were.\n\n> It also said it is in contact with certificate holders who have been importing meat from TFIL to obtain alternative halal-compliant supplies.\n\n> It added that it will be conducting checks to ensure compliance by its certificate holders, and stressed that any use of non-halal compliant supplies would be in breach of Muis halal standards.\n\n> On May 16, Muis said in a Facebook post that it was investigating allegations against TFIL, after the Malaysian authorities suspended a slaughtering approval granted to it.\n\n> The Straits Times understands that imports from TFIL amount to only a portion of imported meat from Australia, and that the supply of halal meat to Muis-certified establishments will not be adversely impacted.\n\n> Malaysian media outlets had reported earlier in May that the suspension of approval followed alleged violations of halal slaughtering procedures.\n\n> Muis had said then that it was working with the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to ascertain relevant information on TFIL from the Australian Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment.\n\n> It had also said that the abattoir is accredited by the SFA to export meat to Singapore.\n\n> In a Facebook post on Tuesday, the head of the council halal supply network, Mr Sharifuddin Mohamed Ali, reiterated Muis' findings, and thanked the Muslim community for its understanding on the matter.\n\n> ""Muis is highly committed to maintaining the integrity of the supply of halal food to the Singapore Muslim community, and will continue to provide updates and advice to the community in this respect,"" he said.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([219, 220], [41], 'NEU'), ([62, 63], [60], 'NEU'), ([219, 220], [60], 'NEU'), ([89], [86, 87], 'NEG'), ([219, 220], [86, 87], 'NEG'), ([219, 220], [134], 'NEU')]

There are edges to the pads yknow#### #### ####[]
"With regards to pad-work with strikes from pad-holder, I think this short [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paCHXpVCBAA) would give you an idea of how intense it might get depending on the goal of the session, this one being fight team selection where durability and mettle would be sorely tested. It is possible to take the short hard edge of the pad to your face, something akin to receiving a stiff jab. Personal experience wise at a previous gym, I have been kneed twice, as well as teeped across the mat (i'm really light, so I tend to take involuntary flight...) during padwork. I didn't really notice if I got any bruises, but the strikes certainly knocked the wind out of me of a couple of seconds. Then I simply got back up and resume the padwork session.\n\n*The one thing about MT training is that progression of training is a very subtle thing, and seldom spelt out verbally. Instructors would observe their batch of students and remember those who have shown potential. Then one day, they would test out the student with a pad-strike and see their reaction. Students just wanting to clock a fitness session would be totally spooked by the strike and it really shows on their face, then the instructor would revert back to not testing that student so much. On the other hand, if you actually took the strike in your stride and so much as react with a grin on your face, your instructor would smile back, and yes from then on, your padwork sessions will be... a little more interesting. It really is that subtle.*\n\n**However, this reply isn't meant to throw shade on the Lena's account, but more about sharing how a padholder may evolve the padwork session to simulate fight conditions.** The investigation would likely shed more light on the specific details of that hard session, such as: what was the exact nature of that physical assessment, did the coach harbour any ill will, accounts from 3rd party observations where available, were the strikes thrown outside of the actual padwork session (?!), etc.\n\nHope this can be resolved definitively, as I really want to see our MT athletes shine on the global stage without getting mired by such incidents."#### #### ####[([109], [11], 'NEU'), ([253, 254], [11], 'NEU'), ([253, 254], [20], 'NEU'), ([341, 342], [20], 'NEU'), ([40], [51], 'NEU'), ([56], [51], 'NEU'), ([253, 254], [51], 'NEU'), ([38], [146], 'NEU'), ([40], [146], 'POS'), ([56], [146], 'NEU'), ([253, 254], [146], 'NEU'), ([341, 342], [146], 'NEU'), ([38], [313], 'NEU'), ([40], [313], 'NEU'), ([56], [313], 'NEU'), ([109], [313], 'NEU')]

"> # Section 377A should not be repealed now: Singapore Archbishop William Goh\n\n> Singapore should not repeal Section 377A, which criminalises sex between men, under present circumstances, Archbishop William Goh said on Tuesday (18 September).\n\n> In a pastoral letter posted on the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore’s website, he also wrote that he would not object to a repeal of the law “if it were merely aimed at removing all potential criminal penalties against homosexuals”.\n\n> “However, until and unless Parliament puts in place a formulation that more perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the law, guaranteeing the protection of the rights of the majority who favour the traditional family, and that no further demands be made to legalise same-sex unions, same-sex adoption of babies, surrogacy, or to criminalise those who do not support the homosexual lifestyle, I am of the view that S377A should not be repealed under the present circumstances,” he added.\n\n> The debate over Section 377A was reignited in recent days after the Indian Supreme Court’s decision earlier this month to strike down a similar law and a top Singapore diplomat urged a challenge to the gay sex ban.\n\n> Petitions have since been started by activists on both sides of the divide, with religious groups weighing in, and a deejay filing a fresh legal challenge. Most Singaporeans still support keeping the ban, a survey showed.\n\n> Minister for Law and Home Affairs K. Shanmugam had said that any decision on 377A is a matter for Parliament. Depending on the legislation, public opinion is “often relevant” during policy making in Parliament, he added.\n\n> Education Minister Ong Ye Kung has also weighed in on the issue, stressing that there is no discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community “at work, housing (and) education” in Singapore.\n\n> In his message, Archbishop Goh touched on the dilemma he is facing over the debate.\n\n> “On one hand, I feel the struggles and pains of those with same-sex attraction, who sincerely love God and desire to live up to His divine plan for humanity,” he wrote.\n\n> “On the other hand, I share the anxieties and fears of those who subscribe to the traditional and scriptural views of marriage and family, that repealing S377A would lead the country down a slippery slope,” he added.\n\n> Nonetheless, he is of the view that Section 377A should not be repealed because “by accepting homosexual acts as a social norm, the dreadful consequences for the stability of our families, the well-being of our children, and the risks to the common good will be long-term and irreversible”.\n\n> He ended his letter with: “Looking at the dire consequences for countries which normalised same-sex unions and the ramifications that followed, may we not repeat the mistake that others have made!

"> # Former bus driver jailed for injuring 14 people in Bukit Batok interchange collision\n\n> SINGAPORE: A former bus driver was on Tuesday (May 31) jailed for causing a two-bus collision at Bukit Batok interchange that injured 14 people last year.\n\n> Loo Eng Chai, 66, was sentenced to six weeks' jail and a five-year driving ban after pleading guilty to one charge of causing grievous hurt to six people through a negligent act.\n\n> Another charge of causing hurt to eight people through a negligent act was taken into consideration for sentencing.\n\n> At about 5.05pm on Jul 11, 2021, Loo had just started to drive bus service 945 operated by Tower Transit. Before starting the route, he checked the vehicle to ensure it was in safe working order.\n\n> Loo had reversed out of his parking lot and was driving along Bukit Batok Interchange when he approached the stop line at a T-junction. However, he failed to stop.\n\n> He continued driving and turned right into the junction without keeping a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles that had the right of way.\n\n> At the same time, another Tower Transit bus was entering the interchange from the main road. Loo failed to give way to this bus, which was travelling from his left to his right.\n\n> Loo collided with the other bus, causing it to topple to the left, fall down a slope and land on its left side. He also admitted to stepping on the accelerator lightly before the collision.\n\n> The impact of the other bus uprooted the roadside fencing at the accident site. The other bus also collided into a bus captain who was taking a break at the lower pavement at the bottom of the slope.\n\n> The incident was captured in photos and security camera footage that were circulated online. Videos of the incident were played in court on Tuesday.\n\n> All 14 injured people were taken to the hospital. This included 12 passengers as well as the driver of the bus that Loo collided into and the bus captain who was on a break.\n\n> The driver of the other bus suffered nasal fractures, hematomas and lacerations on his body. He received 43 days of hospitalisation leave.\n\n> The bus captain who was on a break suffered rib and other fractures and head injuries. He received 83 days of hospitalisation leave.\n\n> Deputy Public Prosecutor Chee Ee Ling sought six to eight weeks' jail and a five-year driving ban, arguing that Loo was driving a heavy vehicle with higher potential for harm.\n\n> Loo continued driving without due regard for the other bus, which had the right of way, said the prosecutor.\n\n> She highlighted that the six victims who experienced grievous hurt suffered injuries of a ""very serious or permanent nature"", which required significant surgical procedures.\n\n> Ms Chee also said that Loo's plea of guilt, show of remorse and absence of prior convictions were mitigating factors.\n\n> She added that the prosecution would not be seeking a compensation order as Loo did not have the means to pay.\n\n> Loo, who was unrepresented, told the court that he was now working as a cleaner, and that he needed to pay rent and support his family in Johor Bahru.\n\n> He asked for leniency so that he could be released ""as soon as possible"" to work and support his family.\n\n> In sentencing, District Judge Brenda Tan said that Loo's actions had caused serious harm and that his culpability was of a moderate to high level.\n\n> For causing grievous hurt through a negligent act that endangered the personal safety of others, Loo could have been jailed up to two years, fined up to S$5,000 or both.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([228], [124], 'NEU'), ([242], [124], 'NEU'), ([292, 294], [124], 'NEU'), ([336, 337], [124], 'NEU'), ([184, 186], [213], 'NEU'), ([292, 294], [213], 'NEU'), ([336, 337], [213], 'NEU'), ([352], [213], 'NEU'), ([366, 367], [213], 'NEU'), ([242], [243], 'NEU'), ([336, 337], [243], 'NEU'), ([184, 186], [265], 'NEU'), ([292, 294], [265], 'NEU'), ([336, 337], [265], 'NEU'), ([104, 105], [311], 'NEU'), ([146, 147], [311], 'NEU'), ([184, 186], [311], 'NEU'), ([228], [311], 'NEU'), ([242], [311], 'NEU'), ([292, 294], [311], 'NEU'), ([587, 588], [311], 'NEU'), ([184, 186], [349], 'NEU'), ([255, 256], [349], 'NEU'), ([352], [349], 'NEU'), ([184, 186], [414], 'NEU'), ([228], [414], 'NEU'), ([242], [414], 'NEU'), ([292, 294], [414], 'NEU'), ([336, 337], [414], 'NEU'), ([104, 105], [452], 'NEU'), ([146, 147], [452], 'NEU'), ([184, 186], [452], 'NEU'), ([242], [452], 'NEU'), ([255, 256], [452], 'NEU'), ([292, 294], [452], 'NEU'), ([336, 337], [452], 'NEU'), ([352], [452], 'NEU'), ([366, 367], [452], 'NEU'), ([184, 186], [458], 'NEU'), ([242], [458], 'NEU'), ([255, 256], [458], 'NEU'), ([292, 294], [458], 'NEU'), ([336, 337], [458], 'NEU'), ([352], [458], 'NEU'), ([587, 588], [458], 'NEU'), ([29, 30], [479], 'NEU'), ([104, 105], [479], 'NEU'), ([146, 147], [479], 'NEU'), ([184, 186], [479], 'NEU'), ([228], [479], 'NEU'), ([242], [479], 'NEU'), ([255, 256], [479], 'NEU'), ([277, 278], [479], 'NEU'), ([278], [479], 'NEU'), ([292, 294], [479], 'NEU'), ([336, 337], [479], 'NEU'), ([352], [479], 'NEU'), ([366, 367], [479], 'NEU'), ([587, 588], [479], 'NEU'), ([184, 186], [496, 497], 'NEU'), ([292, 294], [496, 497], 'NEU'), ([184, 186], [574], 'NEU'), ([242], [574], 'NEU'), ([292, 294], [574], 'NEU'), ([336, 337], [574], 'NEU'), ([184, 186], [585], 'NEU'), ([228], [585], 'NEU'), ([242], [585], 'NEU'), ([255, 256], [585], 'NEU'), ([278], [585], 'NEU'), ([292, 294], [585], 'NEU'), ([336, 337], [585], 'NEU'), ([352], [585], 'NEU'), ([587, 588], [585], 'NEU')]

Simple: We currently enforce other traffic laws with negligible societal costs (eg parking enforcement outside commercial areas). Why would we prioritise those over road safety measures with a direct societal and economic cost?\n\nNote Economic costs of child injury is far greater than that for adults given longer lifetimes over which costs (including productivity costs to the individual and their families) may manifest.\n\nI personally believe it’s worth enforcing existing road safety laws in the manner of other first world nations. Singapore’s failure to do so indicates an unexpected (to me) prioritisation. \n\nShort of conducting a study that’s about the best you’ll get at 9pm on a Tuesday.#### #### ####[([5, 6], [8], 'NEU')]
"I don’t think you answered my question - I said where’s the urgency, you said if we don’t do it now it will be too late, implying that if we don’t start enforcing now we’ll see an increase number of kids injured/killed because reasons.\n\nI asked what is these reasons and you totally didn’t give any, but start to ramble about kids getting killed/injured having economic cost. \n\nWhy would us not doing anything different from now will lead to greater pandemic of kids having even more number of vehicular related accidents in the future???? \n\nReality disagree with you lady - despite G not enforcing the number of fatalities and injuries are getting lower not higher…. Once again, let me reiterate that the problem is bigger in your head than it really is.\n\nAnd lastly, I’ll just summarise my position and forever stay silent on this topic - not my hill to die on - I fully agree with you that safety is great, and one can easily do more to with at very little cost to improve safety. \n\nHOWEVER, to start doing draconian enforcement to ensure high level of compliance - why??? Where is the fire??? How many kids are we losing each year due to this non-compliance??? Why would anybody sane want to advocate even greater government oversight on something that is literally not an issue? \n\nFFS you are an expat, I’m gonna assume from the western world and I’m surprised you actually want more stricter regulation and enforcement? I thought SG government oversight is already too draconian for most of you guys.\n\nP.S. FWIW it’s as strict in SG as other countries - I’ve lived in NYC and London and even though it’s a must to have child seat rarely do you get stopped by police because of this - that’s if you bump into them even. Trust me if traffic police in SG see kids jumping around they’ll likely pull you over. \n\nYou guys in the western world aren’t doing this because of greater police state, it’s because you guys believe in it. Simply put, many people here don’t share that same risk assessment as you guys, and honestly I don’t see a huge difference in stats either way."#### #### ####[([245], [244], 'NEG')]

Don’t be facetious.

Gosh the folly of Asian stupidity, if only we have more white saviour teaching us how to live better. \n\nOh wait, white saviour wants more police action? Dafuq?

Having said that, the real distress will be the what Malaysian farmers, and Malaysians feel in the future.\n\nHere, it’s a matter of pivoting supply sources. We are no strangers to that, having done so repeatedly whenever our Malaysian neighbours pull the same stunt (pork exports in 1999, seafood in 2019, eggs in 2004 and 2018, now chicken in 2022). The only consequence was supply disruption for 1-3 months, coupled with higher prices, then its business as usual. What usually happens in Malaysia though would be smaller exporters going out of business.\n\nThis is going to be especially acute here since abang has instituted a price cap for almost 2 years, this coupled with rising feed prices and now an export ban will surely kill off the smaller-scale farmers who are already struggling, causing a further dip in available supplies. \n\nWhat worries me is more the political instability that inevitably follows when the food supply is in doubt (French Revolution of 1789, Venezuela 2014, South Sudan 2017, Yemen 2018 etc etc). This will be especially acute as Malaysia is also experiencing rapid currency devaluation as the Malaysian Ringgit is dropping to historical lows, affecting its ability to rely on imports to alleviate the situation. \n\nWhy should we care? Well, I have lots of friends and family in Malaysia, the same as many Singaporeans. Any suffering if their people is suffering of me and mine too when it comes down to it. Secondly, political instability in our neighbours is ultimately going to be bad for stability in the region and thus bad for business, which will affect our livelihoods, one way or the other.\n\nSo while we have fun bashing Malaysian politics and the stupid policies, please spare a thought for the common people. 🙏🏻"#### #### ####[([147, 148], [146], 'NEG')]

">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia will stop exporting chickens from Wednesday in a protectionist move to bolster domestic food supply, sparking distress in neighboring Singapore where chicken rice is a national dish. \n> \n> \n> \n>Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced last week that, beginning June 1, Malaysia will ban exports of 3.6 million chickens a month until domestic prices and production stabilize. The move is felt most in Singapore, which sources a third of its poultry from Malaysia. \n> \n> \n> \n>Almost all the chickens are imported live to Singapore, where they are slaughtered and chilled. Singapore consumers have been rushing to stock up on fresh chicken ahead of the ban, with local media reporting that shelves in some wet markets and supermarkets have been cleared of poultry. \n> \n> \n> \n>The Singapore Straits Times said chicken sellers predicted the cost of chilled chicken could rise by up to 30%, sending chicken dish prices soaring. The Singapore government has urged consumers to switch to frozen chicken and other alternative meats, and is exploring new markets for fresh chicken. \n> \n> \n> \n>But there is concern over the fate of the ubiquitous chicken rice that is sold everywhere from hawker stalls to top hotels. Popular eatery Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, which gets its poultry entirely from Malaysia, reportedly said it will introduce pork and seafood dishes instead of using frozen chicken if it fails to find new suppliers. \n> \n>Malaysia’s protectionist move comes as countries worldwide grapple with soaring food prices, fueled partly by the Ukraine war. Ukraine is a major exporter of corn and grains that are key components of chicken feed. India has restricted sugar and wheat exports, while Indonesia temporarily halted — and then lifted — palm oil sales abroad. \n> \n> \n> \n>Apart from the export ban, Malaysia also abolished import permits for chicken and other foods to boost food supply and curb prices amid public anger. It has earlier capped chicken prices and allocated subsidies for farmers squeezed by rising cost of chicken feed, partly caused by a weakening Malaysian currency. \n> \n> \n> \n>The export ban came as a surprise by Ismail’s government, which took power in August and faces a general election next year. The government is also investigating claims that cartels are controlling the price and supply of chicken. \n> \n> \n> \n>The ban not only caused alarm in Singapore but also troubled smaller Malaysian poultry farmers who supply to Singapore to help keep their operations afloat. The government didn’t say how long the export ban will last, but officials expect supply and prices to normalize within a month."#### #### ####[([352, 353], [147], 'NEU'), ([393], [147], 'NEU'), ([424, 425], [147], 'NEU'), ([352, 353], [250], 'NEU'), ([433], [250], 'POS'), ([352, 353], [277], 'NEU'), ([384], [277], 'NEG'), ([393], [277], 'NEG'), ([424, 425], [277], 'NEU'), ([433], [277], 'NEG'), ([62], [285], 'NEU'), ([142], [285], 'NEU'), ([286], [285], 'NEU'), ([352, 353], [285], 'NEU'), ([384], [285], 'NEU'), ([424, 425], [285], 'NEU'), ([433], [285], 'NEU'), ([62], [289], 'NEU'), ([142], [289], 'NEU'), ([291, 293], [289], 'NEU'), ([384], [289], 'NEU'), ([433], [289], 'NEU'), ([62], [305], 'NEU'), ([142], [305], 'NEU'), ([384], [305], 'NEU'), ([424, 425], [305], 'NEU'), ([433], [305], 'NEU'), ([315, 316], [314], 'NEU'), ([319], [318], 'NEU'), ([60], [326], 'NEU'), ([393], [326], 'NEU'), ([424, 425], [326], 'NEU'), ([62], [336], 'NEU'), ([433], [336], 'NEU'), ([62], [345], 'NEU'), ([433], [345], 'NEG'), ([62], [382], 'NEU'), ([384], [382], 'NEU'), ([62], [402], 'NEU'), ([291, 293], [402], 'NEU'), ([62], [435], 'NEU'), ([142], [435], 'NEU'), ([291, 293], [435], 'NEU'), ([319], [435], 'NEU'), ([352, 353], [435], 'NEU'), ([424, 425], [435], 'NEU'), ([433], [435], 'NEU')]

This could be done even after the bill had been fully paid and the patient discharged. The patient would then be issued a cash refund.\n\n> Ng saw in this an opportunity to misappropriate cash belonging to the hospital, the court heard.\n\n> Each month, he would identify bills involving patients who were foreigners, that were not covered by any insurance, and that amounted to more than S$30,000.\n\n> He selected these patients as he believed they were unlikely to return to Gleneagles Hospital as often as local patients, and less likely to discover that cash refunds had been issued in their name.\n\n> After these patients had made full payment to the hospital and been discharged, Ng would amend their bills to reduce the final amounts or instruct his subordinates to do so. He would then process the cash refunds and keep them.\n\n> In some cases, Ng tried to avoid detection by forging the signatures of the affected patients on cash refund slips issued by the hospital, to give the impression that they had acknowledged receiving the payments.\n\n> He forged such signatures on 36 occasions from March 2017 to January 2018, for amounts ranging up to more than S$26,000.\n\n> Ng used the misappropriated money to fund his personal expenses, including gambling and buying a car.\n\n> He was arrested on Jan 12, 2018. About S$10,700 was recovered at the time, which was returned to Gleneagles Hospital. Ng later made partial restitution of S$48,000 to the hospital in March 2018.\n\n> Deputy Public Prosecutor Dhiraj G Chainani sought at least four-and-a-half years' jail, arguing that Ng's offences took place over a significant period of time and were difficult to detect.\n\n> Ng abused the trust placed in him as a manager and ""carefully adopted a modus operandi"" to misappropriate the money, said the prosecutor.\n\n> In sentencing, the judge also took into consideration Ng's remorse shown by his plea of guilt and partial restitution.\n\n> Ng could have been jailed up to 15 years and fined for committing criminal breach of trust as an employee.\n\n> The offence of forging a document purporting to acknowledge payment is also punishable with up to 15 years' jail and a fine.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([256], [118], 'NEU'), ([367, 369], [118], 'NEU'), ([256], [325], 'NEU'), ([487], [325], 'NEU'), ([367, 369], [481], 'NEU'), ([367, 369], [485], 'NEU'), ([72], [558], 'NEU'), ([256], [558], 'NEU'), ([367, 369], [558], 'NEU'), ([487], [558], 'NEU')]

We cannot emphasise this enough,"" he said.\n\n> Mr Heng was speaking at the opening of the second Asia Tech x Singapore summit at The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore hotel in Marina Bay, organised by the Infocomm Media Development Authority.\n\n> He noted that crypto assets have gathered much interest due to their phenomenal growth and promises of high returns and, more recently, the crash of Terra Luna, which caused many investors to suffer heavy losses and triggered knock-on effects on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n> Nevertheless, Singapore will continue to adapt its rules to ensure that regulation remains facilitative of innovation, the minister said.\n\n> Mr Heng said crypto assets are part of a new wave of emerging digital technologies known loosely as Web 3.0 and the way to approach this is to keep an open mind.\n\n> ""We must pierce through both the hubris and the veil of suspicion to understand the potentially transformative underlying technologies,"" he said. ""Let us not throw out the baby with the bathwater.""\n\n> This is because the digital asset ecosystem comprises an entire range of services beyond cryptocurrency trading.\n\n> ""We remain keen to work with blockchain and digital asset players to encourage innovation, and build up trust in the sector,"" he added.\n\n> In the last two years, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has granted licences and in-principle approvals to 11 digital payment token service providers, including stablecoin players like Paxos, crypto exchanges like Coinhako and traditional financial institutions like DBS Vickers.\n\n> At the same time, MAS has consistently warned the public against trading in cryptocurrencies and took steps to limit promotion of cryptocurrencies to the general public earlier this year.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([27], [34], 'NEU'), ([145], [34], 'NEU'), ([228], [34], 'NEU'), ([257, 259], [34], 'NEU'), ([265], [34], 'NEU'), ([321, 322], [34], 'NEU'), ([324], [34], 'NEU'), ([140], [139], 'POS'), ([145], [144], 'POS'), ([27], [199], 'NEU'), ([265], [199], 'NEU'), ([321, 322], [199], 'NEU'), ([203, 204], [202], 'NEU'), ([321, 322], [202], 'NEU'), ([324], [202], 'NEU'), ([321, 322], [238], 'NEU'), ([324], [238], 'NEU'), ([8], [271], 'NEU'), ([21, 22], [271], 'NEU'), ([27], [271], 'NEU'), ([145], [271], 'NEU'), ([203, 204], [271], 'NEU'), ([257, 259], [271], 'NEU'), ([265], [271], 'NEU'), ([275], [271], 'NEU'), ([228], [350], 'NEU'), ([265], [350], 'NEU')]

"Then let me make this very clear: You are more wrong than you're right.\n\nWe only occasionally see investors go against the market in general because they've done the math and realised things like the stock for a company is valued below the actually assets of the company, or that there will be a rush to buy stock as too many people have shortened it. Mostly most people only react to what other people are doing, or what they think that other people will be doing.\n\nIf for instance a company is reporting less growth than earlier the market drop in value will not represent only that less growth, instead it will be people reacting to what they think that other people will be doing. That's why you often see dips that quickly go deeper than where a stock stabilise perhaps just an hour later. Because people reacted to people, not to actual value.\n\nThere are no schemes or scams or whatever in that, it's just that people react to people, and people invest in other people's willingness to later on pay a different amount of monies for something.

"Uhhhhh what? ""You're never investing in anything, you're investing in hype"""". No dude, a lot of serious investments are done in actual assets/services/infrastructure and stuff that generates value. Of course, everything has a speculative component, but that's not the problem with crypto. The problem with crypto is that there is really no product at all, is just speculative practices of some sort of currencies. ""Yeah, so what, same happens with traditional currency market"", true, but all those currencies are regulated and they have whatever government works in that country. For cryptos you don't have regulation, let alone any sort of government power backing up such currency.

"Reality is essentially a shared delusion where enough people have reached a not too intolerable state of status quo; and within that you will always find spheres of people with shared ideas that they erroneously think would work even at larger scales.\n\nOne such ""delusion"" (or rather illusion) is the objective value of certain things, as discussed in this comment thread.\n\nWithin a stable market you could for instance trade gold as if it has an objective value. But that value comes from people being willing to buy it, so it really just has a subjective value. If you were to get stuck with your gold in a bomb shelter without food or water you'd quickly learn that there's no objective value in gold, because it's practically worthless without people wanting to buy it. (Enough gold bars and it would do a decent job of preventing radiation from nukes, though; so it does work as the super rich man's lead as a construction material in bomb shelters.)\n\nDeFi values sounds great on papper, because just like with my example about gold the DeFI thoughts are happening within a certain type of stable market. So DeFi works when and where DeFi works.\n\nBut look at what happened when the embargos started hitting Russian banks; crypto transfers started happening differently.\n\nAlso look at the amount of hacking and blackmail happening where crypto can be traced going to North Korea.\n\nCertain types of deregulation and decentralisation will at large enough scales simply favour the already rich and powerful, leaving the little person at a disadvantage that we don't have in a more restricted system."#### #### ####[([236], [49], 'POS'), ([236], [93], 'NEU'), ([236], [167], 'POS'), ([236], [255], 'NEU')]

"> # Man fined S$1.16 million for subletting rented properties on AirBnB, HomeAway\n\n> SINGAPORE: A man was fined about S$1.16 million on Monday (May 30) for providing unauthorised short-term accommodation on platforms such as AirBnB and HomeAway.\n\n> Simon Chan Chai Wan, 57, leased 14 units and sublet them out for short-term accommodation. His girlfriend Zhao Jing, 43, was fined S$84,000 for aiding him.\n\n> The fine imposed on Chan is the largest amount that has been meted out for a person in Singapore for such offences, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said.\n\n> Chan and Zhao were both licensed real estate agents at the time, court documents showed. They were also the directors of two companies – HTM Solutions and HTM Management for certain periods between 2016 and 2018. Chan was also the former director of a company called SNS Infotech.\n\n> Court documents showed that Chan leased various private residences to provide short-term accommodation to both local and foreign guests through the three companies, according to court documents.\n\n> The 14 units were in areas such as River Valley Road, Orchard Road, Killiney Road, Robinson Road and Keppel Bay.\n\n> The transactions took place on various platforms, including AirBnB and HomeAway, which allow users to post listings for apartments or houses for short-term stays.\n\n> “(Chan) leased units for the purposes of subletting them out for short-term accommodation,” court documents said.\n\n> He also persuaded Zhao to enter into tenancy agreements with the owners of two of the units.\n\n> Throughout the tenancy period, Chan and Zhao did not inform the owners of the units that they were being sublet out for short-term accommodation. They knew that doing so was illegal, court documents showed.\n\n> Besides helping Chan rent two units as part of the scheme, Zhao also helped him to set up and manage host accounts on the AirBnB platform and to post listings for the units.\n\n> She registered the first host account on AirBnB sometime in 2016 under the name “Jing”, where she listed several units. She also managed guest reservations, answered enquiries and updated the calendar.\n\n> ""Without Zhao’s assistance, Chan would not have been able to carry out the STA operation. Chan took care of matters outside of the accounts, that is, the day-to-day running of the units,"" court documents said.\n\n> Investigations showed that Chan had illegally provided short-term accommodation at 14 premises from Jun 30, 2017 to July 2018. The total revenue that he obtained was S$1,254,907.78.\n\n> Zhao was paid S$4,000 monthly for helping him in the scheme. Between Jun 30, 2017 and Aug 3, 2018, she received an income of about S$52,000.\n\n> Chan pleaded guilty to nine charges under the Planning Act, with another five taken into consideration for sentencing.\n\n> Under URA's regulations, all private residential properties rented out for accommodation purposes are subject to a minimum stay duration of three consecutive months.\n\n> ""Property owners should also exercise due diligence to ensure that their properties are not used by their tenants for unauthorised purposes,"" said URA.\n\n> ""Unauthorised short-term accommodation with frequent turnover of transient guests not only changes the residential character of a property, but also causes dis-amenities to neighbouring residents.\n\n> ""URA will continue to take strong enforcement actions against short-term accommodation offenders, including property owners, tenants, agents and anyone found to have assisted in such illicit activities, in order to safeguard the interest of the community.""\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"#### #### ####[([118, 119], [27], 'NEU'), ([297, 298], [70], 'NEU'), ([297, 302], [70], 'NEU'), ([301, 302], [70], 'NEU'), ([314, 315], [70], 'NEU'), ([115, 116], [114], 'NEU'), ([34], [431], 'NEU'), ([118, 119], [431], 'NEU'), ([34], [463], 'NEU'), ([118, 119], [463], 'NEU'), ([34], [504], 'NEU'), ([86, 88], [504], 'NEU'), ([115, 116], [504], 'NEU'), ([118, 119], [504], 'NEU'), ([297, 298], [504], 'NEU'), ([297, 302], [504], 'NEU'), ([301, 302], [504], 'NEU'), ([506, 507], [504], 'NEU'), ([34], [523], 'NEU'), ([86, 88], [523], 'NEU'), ([115, 116], [523], 'NEU'), ([118, 119], [523], 'NEU'), ([297, 298], [523], 'NEU'), ([297, 302], [523], 'NEU'), ([301, 302], [523], 'NEU'), ([34], [543], 'NEU'), ([86, 88], [543], 'NEU'), ([115, 116], [543], 'NEU'), ([118, 119], [543], 'NEU')]

After arriving in the UK, visa holders with a bachelor's or master's degree will have two years to look for a job, while those with a PhD will be given three years to look for jobs.

Uber doesn't need to come back because they have a stake in grab. They have the benefit of not having to price war with grab while having the flexibility to exit/increase their exposure to the ride hailing business in SEA by selling or buying the stock.\n\nUber coming back would just mean both sides get less profitable and no way they would want to go back to that ..Uber themselves only recently just turn an operating profit in the end of 2021 and are hoping to sustain that.\n\nUber loss billions for more than a decade before turning a profit and grab would be in a similar boat .. Grab has even larger ambitions with their foray into Fintech and only time will tell if they would ever be successful with both their attempts..#### #### ####[([35, 37], [110], 'NEU'), ([111], [110], 'NEU')]

I think both companies will struggle to make a profit and Uber in particular has run up massive debts which it will perhaps never be able to repay. Here is an interesting article which suggests the same https://doctorow.medium.com/the-big-lie-that-keeps-the-uber-bezzle-alive-8d6e8c0ccde7#### #### ####[]
"Uber themselves are also unprofitable with no guidance on when they can turn a net profit. Like Grab, their business model is also questionable and even more so if they come back and try to compete in this tiny saturated market.\n\nAlso will not solve the even bigger current problem: the lack of drivers. Many quit and changed jobs during the pandemic and they aren't coming back for various reasons. The money needs to be higher to get them back and all these surge incentives are still *not enough*.\n\nWith VC money drying up, it will be interesting where these poorly-designed businesses will go lol."#### #### ####[([19, 20], [23], 'NEG')]
"I'm very confused by what people want.\n\nAt the current ""high prices"", they aren't profitable.\n\nSo the solution is to have more competition to get lower prices and they'll somehow make a profit?\n\nI do like how people will cry about grab being a loss-making machine and then demand low prices.\n\nThe good times weren't going to last."#### #### ####[([24], [23], 'NEG')]
Why would they? Unless they can pay out Softbank investment and do their own shit (which they can't)\n\nMarket conditions is the enemy now.

I'm seeing Uber and Uber Eats job postings in Singapore in the past week on LinkedIn. How strange! It is APAC focused so they might be coming back or perhaps having APAC HQ here to serve APAC markets outside of SEA.#### #### ####[]
"it's still cheap to take cab anywhere, can't say the same for grab due to surge pricing. maybe cos they are subsidising all the other currently unprofitable areas like grab-whatever. Uber already owns a big piece of grab anyway"#### #### ####[]
What's Uber going to do? Come back and lose even more money?#### #### ####[]
"Uber didn't leave, they own a 27.5% stake in Grab. They'll make money eventually and they don't need to do a single thing. \n\nThey can only come back if the sell most (or all) of their 27.5% stake. With Grab's stock price having plunged, they're not likely to do this anytime soon."#### #### ####[]
Is Lyft in singapore ?#### #### ####[]
\n>I do like how people will cry about grab being a loss-making machine and then demand low prices.\n\n... Who cries about grab being a loss making machine? The only people who care whether grab is profitable are the investors. I really don't think riders give a shit.#### #### ####[]
"An elegant matchmaking platform for drivers and users will remain at that, a low profit margin business. If grab dies (unlikely at this point since too much sunk cost), the concept stays and another will take its place where most of the takings to drivers and lower the price optimal level since there is no hefty middleman charges. \n\nTada still being around is a testimony to this model being somewhat sustainable to some extent. Whether the grab/uber model should command such high valuation while selling themselves as being profit super center by killing all other competitors through sheer capital dominance to become a monopoly is the sketchy aspect of Grab/Uber (Also softbank with its many investments). \n\nThere is a good reason why taxi services were all hyperlocal businesses in the past. Nothing about the economics of such business has changed. At its core, Grab/Uber introduced a terrific replacement to people flagging down cabs on the road and calling taxi call centres for advance bookings, nothing much more at this point. \n\nIn essence, what people want is for price to being more reasonable and drivers wants to maximize their takings. The solution? Minimize middleman cost to optimize supply and demand."#### #### ####[([2, 3], [1], 'POS'), ([48, 50], [46], 'NEU'), ([177], [46], 'NEU'), ([177], [81], 'NEU'), ([2, 3], [106], 'NEU'), ([177], [106], 'NEU'), ([192, 193], [106], 'NEU'), ([177], [106, 107], 'NEG'), ([48, 50], [146], 'NEU'), ([177], [181], 'NEU'), ([2, 3], [191], 'NEU'), ([48, 50], [191], 'NEU'), ([122, 123], [191], 'NEU'), ([192, 193], [191], 'NEU')]
">So the solution is to have more competition to get lower prices and they'll somehow make a profit?\n\nostensibly with market competition, grab will have to reduce prices to get more customers, and then trim the fat in their HQ operations so as to become profitable.

i remember reading somewhere that COE actually incentivizes congestion because its a sunk cost so people feel the need to use the car to get their moneys worth. to properly deal with congestion we should scrap COE and make ERP much higher instead so that u are focusing on taxing the usage of the car and not the ownership of it#### #### ####[([13], [12], 'NEG')]

"First, I can guarantee you it's not just dudes changing their behavior in an attempt to suit a crush's tastes.\n\nThe same line of reasoning can also be used to explain some behaviors carried over from past experience. Maybe this guy's previous partner may have dumped them for some reason that is now leading to the immature behavior. Like if guy is immature by throwing around cash, maybe it's because a past gf dumped him for not spending enough on her or being ""cheap"" and now he's worried it'll happen again with OP. Maybe the guy makes crass jokes because everyone always just ""laughs"" to avoid a conflict and nobody has talked to him about when they're appropriate yet.\n\nAs for your smoking example, I've seen compromise happen multiple times between romantic partners as well as friends. Some people just can't stand the strong smell, and are fine if the smoker does so only outdoors and cleans themselves up after. For others, it was more of a deal breaker and became the additional motivation the smoker needed to quit.\n\nNot everything is so black and white and not everyone is so set in their ways. Do you think people spontaneously change on their own? More often than not, there's an external spark. Typically a friend, a family member, a crush, something or someone causes a person to reflect on their thoughts or behaviors.\n\nIf there's no discussion, there's no chance. If there is a discussion, maybe it works, maybe it still falls though, but at least there's a chance for growth or at least understanding."#### #### ####[]

Looking back, I was the first child and my parents probably had no idea how to deal with a mischievous boy on top of other responsibilities in life.\n\nI turned out fine but I was never close to them.\n\nWhen my wife was expecting my girl. I started to worry. Despite knowing that I strived not to be like my parents, I also acknowledged the human tendency to choose the familiar. \n\nImplanted in my mind was this warped logic- If I turned out fine, therefore hard love and violence should be okay for my girl, it was also the only method I knew.\n\nSo started asking around and went for a course recommended by a friend. I honestly thought that being soft makes you weak but I told myself- Go learn something, if it fails, I can always go back to what I am good at.\n\nI learned that despite our good intentions, it was the way we speak/communicate that was crucial- how someone can perceive your good intention differently. I learned that approaching things empathetically helps lower defenses and alleviates anxiety. I learned the difference between being soft and firm. I learned that I can choose to be a father my girl feared, a father she will come when she only needs things or be a father that she can talk to. \n\nI observed that change is hard, the older participants in my course found it harder to adapt than the younger participants.\n\nI learned that knowing is not enough, it’s like learning a magic trick and there is a need to keep practising and reflecting. I practised on my nieces and colleagues.\n\nI learned that in our asian culture, we were taught to dismiss our feelings and it has effects on us- I observed that an angmo can go elaborate how fantastic their day was with a range of feeling descriptions. An Asian usually would say that their day was “So-So” or “Okay”. \n\nI noticed that the lesser time we spent with our children, the more tendency we will overcompensate to cover our guilt. The older generation may not understand that.\n\nI know there are many views out there. I just want to say that I still know how to treat someone with hard love and violence but I choose not to. I think it was a quote from Kindness Diary- “Although life may always contain both darkness and light, ultimately when we open our eyes to the world around us, it is our choice to decide how we see it.”\n\nYes, this world can be cruel and harsh.

They made us the men and women we are today.\n\n> Sadly, I don't think this will apply to young people in the future, now that those disciplinary methods are no longer considered acceptable in class.\n\n> I have heard many stories from my teacher friends about students rolling their eyes at or shouting back at teachers, and being rude to them. I can't imagine this behaviour being tolerated by my teachers when I was in school.\n\n> Young people today learn from their parents, whether directly or indirectly, that it is all right to be disrespectful to their teachers.\n\n> They follow the examples of their parents, who talk to teachers and treat them as if they don't matter.

If there's nothing done at home, there's very little the school can do.\n\nIts quite sad that when I was still teaching, I discovered that a lot of processes in school were done in a particular way because ""parents will ask"" or ""we will have to answer to the parents""."#### #### ####[([94], [18], 'NEG'), ([94], [81], 'NEG')]

"My primary 4 Chinese teacher hated me and tormented me. She told my only friend not to be friends with me, ignore me when I tried to participate in class (raised my hand), insisted (when she arrived at the classroom) that she heard me talking between lessons and hence I must stand in the corridor for the whole lesson (on hindsight, to humiliate me as the other classes stream out for recess), made me sit all the way at the back of the class and basically ignored my existence, grabbed my shirt and pulled me back and forth like trying to punch me.\n\nThese didn't help my self esteem as my whole class was rich (good school, best class) and I was pretty damn poor.

The teacher continued to berate the student, is he worth the respect then?\n\nAnother example which I vividly recalled of my pri 3/4 teacher making me copied the timetable 100x for forgetting to bring textbook/assessment book. My parents had to help me with drawing the boxes and I spent sleepless hours during the night doing it. It was just excessive and ridiculous. My parents being not so well educated also did not spoke out on my behalf.\n\nDwelling further into the past, I was slapped in primary 2 by a teacher for not even my fault, when a friend was making a lot of noise in the toilet. That teacher went in and slapped every girls in the toilet. I happened to open the cubicle door and was slapped too. Totally no link between slapping and respect, more like instilling fear in young kids.\n\nWho can stand on behalf of students if teachers abuse their power?

"Hi, I hope you are feeling good today. :)\n\nI cannot help to agree that I felt this animosity towards my parents when I was younger. They kept saying that they are doing the best for me but their actions contradicted. I cannot help to feel despair, anger which resulted in hate. I wished I could choose my parents. I blamed my unhappy childhood on them. I felt like i could not cry for them during their funerals.\n\nIn retrospect, I was a child who did not get much help processing what was going on. I was left to deal with this all alone and was expected to grow up. \n\nThis child is still inside me, it comes out once a while whenever I see children who acted mischievously like me. I would be hostile/mean to these kids and try to make them change. Then I realised that I see them in me and was trying to “help myself”. It was pretty messed up. \n\nBro, you have the right to feel the way you are now. But what I am saying is you will be carrying this huge mess of unprocessed feelings and it will produce thought and manifest in actions. I have completely no idea how that will affect you.\n\nI am now on a journey to forgive my parents. The most liberating moment was sitting down and telling my mother the day which hurt me the most and what she did. There was silence. She confessed she totally had no recollection and apologised if it hurt me. For 30 years, I kept that shit in me and expected her to remember! I cried a little and hugged her. I was glad I was able to let go of that. The funny thing was- it was not about her apology, rather the changed was within me, the “liberation”. My mother didn’t change, I accepted that too.\n\nYou must be wondering why did I start doing this? Because there are people I love and all these are really affecting me. I just want to grow and let go of the mask and armour I had developed over the years to protect myself… when I was child left to my own device to fend for myself. It’s a good armour.

">those food delivery apps take \~30% fee which is simply not sustainable for small stalls\n\nAnd people often forget that that's 30% out of the ""profit"" part of the sale. So if a plate of food would be 50% costs (groceries etc) and 50% towards their salary, then suddenly it's 50% to the regular costs, 30% to the service, and 20% to the salary.\n\nThat's 60% of their salary gone for every regular customer that try to support them by conveniently using their new digital service.\n\nIf they are currently at 100 customers for a certain period of time, they with the digital service now get 150 customers for the same period of time; with 25 regulars switching to using the new digital service that means:\n\nFirst their salary from regulars that show up and pay as usually drop to 75%.\n\nThen out of that other half of customers that use the digital service is 60% less; so that's 75 + (75 \* .4) = 105 total.\n\nSo that person is now making only 5% more money, but have to do 150% of the work that they used to do (which might be beyond what their small business can handle); and their costs are now actually higher because not only did they have to carry more (so maybe get something for that) but they also must have greater margins to cover great days vs bad day etc.\n\nAnd to top it all off these digital services sometimes withhold all money until the end of the next month before paying out, and they mercilessly remove any transactions that for some reason didn't go through.\n\nSo the business owner is doing 150% of their regular work for practically no extra profit, they take on a greater risk, and for up to two months they don't get any money at all for the digital sales. Aaaand since 50% of each plate is costs, and half the sales are digital they for these two months get zero salary for themselves. Aaaaaaaand if they are a digital success with more than 50% of the sales being digital it means that they personally would have to put cash into the business to cover the costs while they're getting no salary.\n\nSo even a success case would be no extra money, more risk, and without salary also practically running the business at a loss for two months."#### #### ####[([147, 148], [10, 11], 'NEG'), ([196], [10, 11], 'NEG'), ([315], [10, 11], 'NEG'), ([384], [10, 11], 'NEG'), ([1, 3], [118], 'NEU'), ([119, 120], [118], 'NEU'), ([315], [118], 'NEU'), ([1, 3], [200], 'NEU'), ([196], [200], 'NEG'), ([315], [200], 'NEU'), ([384], [200], 'NEG'), ([1, 3], [221], 'NEU'), ([119, 120], [221], 'NEU'), ([147, 148], [221], 'NEU'), ([315], [221], 'NEU'), ([384], [221], 'NEG'), ([315], [317], 'NEU'), ([1, 3], [368], 'NEU'), ([147, 148], [368], 'NEU'), ([147, 148], [387], 'NEU'), ([196], [387], 'NEG'), ([315], [387], 'NEG'), ([384], [387], 'NEG')]

"(Replying to myself here, because major edit otherwise.)\n\nI actually believe that there's a very good startup idea here.\n\nYou will always have these businesses that will essentially be outside of these technical support systems that are almost required today, and you will always have loyal customers that will want to do more to help.\n\nI think that a community service clearly run by those loyal customers could be a good thing.\n\nSo you have a community where a business is added, and that profile is similar to foursquare with mayors etc; and there you list things about that business. For instance you might list a service whereby someone ""manually"" go to a hawker to buy and deliver food to you. Or you list different social media profiles run by fans, and you get semi-official hashtags going so that the profile automatically include these posts. And you make sure to do good SEO for this profile.\n\nAnd you explain this to the business so you get official support and is allowed to put up a tag (NFC, QR, maybe BT-beacon) at that business.\n\n(I believe that this easily could be developed into a profitable startup, and even get government grants for supporting the community. It's not a business I'm in position to start and run, but I would love to in one way or another support such a project as a CTO or tech strategist etc.)\n\nEdit: Please add a comment if you're downvoting this, I would love the feedback."#### #### ####[([30, 32], [14], 'NEU'), ([80], [14], 'POS'), ([102], [14], 'POS'), ([121, 123], [14], 'NEU'), ([30, 32], [43], 'NEU'), ([56, 57], [43], 'NEU'), ([121, 123], [43], 'NEU'), ([80], [82], 'NEU'), ([121, 123], [120], 'NEU'), ([30, 32], [147], 'NEU'), ([56, 57], [147], 'NEU'), ([80], [147], 'NEU'), ([30, 32], [240], 'NEU'), ([56, 57], [240], 'NEU'), ([80], [240], 'NEU'), ([102], [240], 'POS'), ([121, 123], [240], 'NEU')]
